
The Classical is the simple, natural way of meeting the Pirc Defense. Rather than being provoked into an attack, White simply occupies the center with the e- and d- pawns and develops his knights to their natural posts.
Pros:

White creates no weaknesses
Very sound play
White's pieces develop quickly

Cons:

Blocking the f-pawn impedes attacking chances
The Nf3 move precludes most kingside pawn storms
Black can sometimes pin the knight with ...Bg4
