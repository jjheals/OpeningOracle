Besides the options of accepting or declining the king's gambit, Black can also offer a counter-gambit with 2...d5. By this move, Black hopes to clear out the center, leaving White's position exposed by the f2-f4 advance.
Pros:

Fights to take the initiative
Knocks out White's central pawn

Cons:

Black may lose time dealing with the central pawns after 3.exd5
The black king can be exposed to pins on the e-file
