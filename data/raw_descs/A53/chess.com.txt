
The Old Indian was the original version of the King's Indian. Unlike the classical defenses to 1.d4, Black does not block the d-pawn, but instead prepares ...e5, attacking that pawn. Compared to the King's Indian, Black does not fianchetto the king's bishop in the Old Indian, preferring instead ...Be7.
Pros:

More solid than the King's Indian
The bishop on e7 keeps d6 well guarded
Attacks d4 earlier, thus precluding the Saemisch and other variations

Cons:

More passive than the King's Indian
The king's bishop is usually less active
Less flexible than the King's Indian
