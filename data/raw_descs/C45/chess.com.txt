The Mieses Variation of the Scotch involves Black attacking the e4-pawn with 4...Nf6, and White responding by exchanging on c6 and advancing the e-pawn to attack the knight.
Pros:

White gains lots of space
The black knight gets kicked around
Various attacks on the black king are possible

Cons:

White can be behind in development
The white position becomes dangerously over-extended
Black will get lots of pressure on the white e-pawn
