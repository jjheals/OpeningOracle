In playing the Kan, Black is keeping his position as flexible as possible. The dark-squared bishop is free to go to various places, and the knight doesn't go to f6 immediately. Black's 4...a6 not only guards the d6 square against Nb5, but also prepares a possible ...b5.
Pros:

Very flexible play
Provocative and tricky

Cons:

White can gain a lead in development
White has various attacking possibilities
White maintains possibilities of c2-c4
