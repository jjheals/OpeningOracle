Starting Position
The Two Knights Defense starts after the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6. Black responds to White's Italian Game more aggressively than the usual Giuoco Piano by developing a knight and inviting White to attack the f7-pawn.

The starting position of the Two Knights Defense.

The idea behind Black's third move is to trade a pawn for rapid piece development in case White decides to attack the f7-pawn immediately.
Pros

Black fights for the initiative
It can result in an original gambit-style game.
Black can develop the f8-bishop to squares other than c5.

Cons

White can virtually win a pawn by force.
White gets to choose between sharp, gambit play or a slow game.

Variations
When Black plays the Two Knights Defense, White can choose a positional or an aggressive approach. The critical lines come with the latter when White accepts Black's challenge and immediately attacks the f7-pawn. However, the Black player needs to know the most popular lines in either case.
Fried Liver Attack
The Fried Liver Attack is the most dangerous line for Black, with White winning 86% of games. This variation occurs after the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5 6.Nxf7. White sacrifices a knight to take the f7-pawn and fork Black's queen and rook, forcing Black to respond with 6...Kxf7.
The point of this maneuver is that White can force the black king to the middle of the board, where it'll be tough for Black to keep it safe. White's initiative more than compensates for the material disadvantage. For this reason, Black should avoid the Fried Liver and instead enter the Polerio Defense.

Knight Attack, Polerio Defense
The Polerio Defense is the most accurate way of playing against the Knight Attack. Black enters this line after the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Na5. Instead of recapturing the pawn on d5, Black focuses on piece development and attacks White's bishop. White will either lose the bishop pair or invest another tempo moving their bishop to a suboptimal square.

Modern Bishop's Opening
White's most popular response by far is to ignore Black's 3...Nc6 tease and play normal developing moves. The game then enters the Modern Bishop's Opening with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d3. White defends the e4-pawn and opens up the diagonal for their dark-squared bishop. From there, the game can either transpose to the Giuoco Piano or remain in the Two Knights Defense.

Open Variation
Another way for White to play is with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d4. White strikes on the center immediately, focusing on development rather than material. However, the Open Variation is one of the worst-scoring lines for White—which explains why masters rarely employ it.

Best Scoring Lines For White In The Two Knights Defense
As mentioned above, White gets to choose the style of game that suits them best. Players can adopt an aggressive approach or a positional game. Below you can see the best-scoring lines in each case:
Modern Bishop's Opening
For the positional player, the Modern Bishop's Opening with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d3 is the best way to go. White wins 38% of games in this variation, draws 32%, and loses 29%.

Polerio Defense, Bishop Check Line
For the more tactical players, the Bishop Check Line of the Polerio Defense is the best scoring. After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Na5 6.Bb5+ White wins 43% of games, draws 22%, and loses 35%. White scores even better after the popular moves 6...c6 7.dxc6 bxc6 Bd3, winning 48%, drawing 23%, and losing 29%.

Of course, White should not rshy away from playing the Fried Liver if Black allows it.
Best Scoring Lines For Black In The Two Knights Defense
The Black player who chooses the Two Knights Defense must know how to reply to White's positional or tactical responses. Below you can see the best-scoring lines for Black in either type of game:
Giuoco Piano
If White goes for the positional approach with 4.d3, transposing to the Giuoco Piano of the Italian Game is the best-scoring system for Black. After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d3 Bc5, Black wins 30%, draws 34%, and loses 36%.

Modern Bishop's Opening
The main line of the Modern Bishop's Opening is another good-scoring line for Black. This variation is a good fit for the Black player who wants to keep the game in the Two Knights Defense territory but maintain a solid position. It occurs after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d3 Be7 and Black wins 28%, draws 33%, and loses 39% in master games. Although it scores worse than the Giuoco Piano among professionals, this line scores better among club players.

Polerio Defense
If White opts for the tactical approach and plays 4.Ng5, Black should play the Polerio Defense. After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Na5 Black wins 36%, draws 22%, and loses 42%.

History Of The Two Knights Defense
The Two Knights Defense is one of the oldest openings in chess history. Polerio was the first to record and analyze it around 1580. Much of its theory was developed during the 19th century by players such as Karel Traxler and Lionel Kieseritzky.
The opening's reputation remained solid among top players throughout the years. The opening is not as common in elite-level games, but mainly because grandmasters playing White usually prefer the Ruy Lopez instead of the Italian Game. However, Mikhail Chigorin and GMs Paul Keres, Mikhail Tal, and Boris Spassky are only a few of the great players who employed it during their careers.
Famous Games
There are several famous games in the Two Knights Defense. Below you can see a few of the notable examples of top-level players employing this opening.
Max Euwe vs. Richard Reti, 1920

Belov vs. Nezhmetdinov, 1961

Magnus Carlsen vs. Bu Xiangzhi, 2017

Polerio vs. Domenico, 1610

The Italian Game is a family of chess openings beginning with the moves:

1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bc4
This opening is defined by the development of the white bishop to c4 (the so-called "Italian bishop"), where it attacks Black's vulnerable f7-square. It is part of the large family of Open Games or Double King's Pawn Games.
The Italian Game is one of the oldest recorded chess openings; it occurs in the Göttingen manuscript and was developed by players such as Damiano and Polerio in the 16th century, and later by Greco in 1620, who gave the game its main line. It has been extensively analyzed for more than 300 years. 
The term Italian Game is sometimes used interchangeably with Giuoco Piano, although the latter also refers particularly to play after 3...Bc5.[1]
The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings gives the Italian Game ten codes: C50–C54 for the Giuoco Piano, and C55–C59 for the Two Knights Defense. Side lines are covered under C50.


Main variations[edit]
Black's two main options are 3...Bc5, the Giuoco Piano, and 3...Nf6, the Two Knights Defense. They are about equally popular,[2] but the resulting positions usually have a very different character.

abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghTwo Knights Defense 3...Nf6


3...Bc5[edit]
Main article: Giuoco Piano
Until the 19th century, this line was the main line of the Italian Game. Dubbed the Giuoco Piano ("Quiet Game") in contrast to the more aggressive lines then being developed, this continues 4.d3, the positional Giuoco Pianissimo ("Very Quiet Game"), or the main line 4.c3 (the original Giuoco Piano) leading to positions first analyzed by Greco in the 17th century, and revitalized at the turn of the 20th by the Moller Attack. 4.0-0 will usually transpose into the Giuoco Pianissimo after 4...Nf6 5.d3, while 4.Nc3 Nf6 is a transposition into the Four Knights Game.
Another option for White is the aggressive Evans Gambit (4.b4), a popular opening in the 19th century which is still occasionally played. The Italian Gambit (4.d4) may transpose into the Scotch Gambit after 4...exd4; however, this move order allows Black the option of 4...Bxd4, so if White wants a Scotch Gambit, 3.d4 is usually preferred. The Jerome Gambit (4.Bxf7+) is unsound.


3...Nf6[edit]
Main article: Two Knights Defense
3...Nf6 is the more aggressive Two Knights Defense. This is more in the nature of a counterattack, and some (e.g. Bronstein) have proposed it be renamed so.
If White attempts to exploit the weakness of Black's f7-pawn with 4.Ng5, Black may try the knife-edged Traxler/Wilkes-Barre Variation (4...Bc5!?). After the more common 4...d5 5.exd5, Black generally avoids 5...Nxd5 allowing 6.Nxf7, the Fegatello or Fried Liver Attack, or 6.d4, the Lolli Variation, both of which are difficult to defend under practical conditions. Most common is 5...Na5, sacrificing a pawn for an active position. The very sharp Fritz Variation (5...Nd4) and the closely related Ulvestad Variation (5...b5) lead to wild positions with little margin for error for either side.
A quieter option for White is 4.d3, when Black's main options are 4...Bc5, transposing into the Giuoco Pianissimo, and the solid 4...Be7, which is likely to lead to similar positions to the Bishop's Opening.
Alternatively, White can play 4.d4, which may lead to the Scotch Gambit after the usual reply 4...exd4.

Uncommon 3rd moves for Black[edit]
3...Be7 (Hungarian Defense). A solid, drawish defense which is occasionally seen in tournament play to avoid the complexities and risks of the other lines.
3...d6 (Semi-Italian Opening). Another solid positional line, popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but rarely seen today.
3...g6. Allows White to attack with 4.d4 (4.d3 has also been tried) 4...exd4 5.c3! (5.Nxd4 and 5.Bg5 are also possible) 5...dxc3 6.Nxc3 Bg7 and now 7.Qb3 (Unzicker) or 7.Bg5 (O'Kelly).
3...Nd4 (Blackburne Shilling Gambit). This ostensibly weak third move is a false gambit expectant upon White falling into the trap of capturing Black's undefended pawn (4.Nxe5?! Qg5). While generally considered time-wasting against more experienced players due to 4.Nxd4! exd4 5.c3, it has ensnared many chess novices and can provide a quick and easy mate against players unfamiliar with the line.
3...f5 (Rousseau Gambit). White does best to avoid the pawn offer with 4.d3 or 4.d4.
3...Qf6. After 3...Qf6?! 4.Nc3 Nge7 5.Nb5 White has a clear advantage (Unzicker).
3...h6. Neglects Black's development and is generally considered a waste of time;[3] however, the move has no immediate refutation and has been tried by Czech grandmaster Pavel Blatny.[4]
