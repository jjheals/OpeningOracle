
The Saemisch response to the King's Indian - developed by Fritz Saemisch - anchors the e4 pawn solidly while also preventing ...Ng4 as a response to Be3. The future play may involve a wild game with opposite-side castling, or an attempt by White to slowly squeeze Black using his space advantage.
Pros:

Provides a strong pawn center
Allows Be3 without the response ...Ng4
Supports a pawn storm on the kingside

Cons:

Blocks the knight's natural square, f3
Weakens the h4-e1 diagonal
Slightly weakens the dark-squares
