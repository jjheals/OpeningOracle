In the "modern" way of meeting the Petrov, White fully breaks open the center rather than taking the e5 pawn right away. This can lead to position where White captures on e5 with the pawn, or positions where he captures with the knight anyway, but the knight tends not to be chased back immediately.
Pros:

Somewhat less explored than the "classical" line
Aggressive

Cons:

When a pawn later captures on e5, Black gains the c5 square to use
When the knight later captures on e5, Black can try to exchange it off and gain time
