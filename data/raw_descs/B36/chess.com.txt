In the Accelerated Dragon, Black fianchettos the king-bishop, giving it a great diagonal, cutting through the center. He does so while leaving the d7-pawn at home and avoids an earlier ...Nf6 (unlike the regular Dragon). 
Pros:

Black creates a position without weaknesses
The bishop takes an active diagonal
Compared to the normal Dragon, Black can potentially play ...d5 in one move.

Cons:

Black allows 5.c4, the Maroczy Bind
In some variations White can get an attack by h4-h5
White usually gets more space
