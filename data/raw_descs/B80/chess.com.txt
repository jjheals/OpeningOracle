In the Sicilian Scheveningen Black creates a 'small center' with the solid ...e6 and ...d6 moves. Classical development - ...Be7, ...0-0, etc - prepares later counterplay on the queenside or in the center.
Pros:

A solid beginning but still an unbalanced game
Learning Scheveningen structures is fundamental to understanding the Sicilian in general
Unlike many Sicilians, Black develops relatively quickly

Cons:

White gets the opportunity to attack sharply with 6.g4 - the Keres attack
Less aggressive than the - related - Najdorf
Black is less flexible about his development plan
