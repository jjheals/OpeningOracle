
The Albin Counter-Gambit offers a 'real' gambit in response to the Queen's Gambit. Black seeks to knock out the d4 pawn and then push his d5 pawn to d4, gaining space.
Pros:

Aggressive
Unusual
Black gains space

Cons:

White will be up a pawn
White can fianchetto the Bf1 and get strong pressure
The d4-pawn can be undermined
