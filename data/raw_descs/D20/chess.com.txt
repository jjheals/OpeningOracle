
Black may answer the Queen's Gambit by accepting the 'gambit'. Although Black does not usually keep the extra pawn, the point is to create free piece play by clearing out the center.
Pros:

Leads to freedom for many of Black's pieces
Opens the long diagonal
Gives the possibility of a counter-attack on d4

Cons:

Gives White two center pawns to one
Opens the c-file for White
Allows the Bf1 to later capture on c4 in one move
