
In the Classical Sicilian, Black takes control of e5 with 2...d6 and develops both knights, keeping the possibilities of ...g6 or ...e5, depending on what White does. The Richter-Rauzer is a way for White to meet the Classical Sicilian, in which White makes both ...g6 and ...e5 less desirable.
Pros:

Avoids transposing to a Dragon or allowing ...e5
Develops rapidly
Prepares to castle queenside with a sharp game

Cons:

Black can sometimes take advantage of the position of the bishop on g5
Fairly theoretical
