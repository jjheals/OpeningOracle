The Najdorf is one of the most popular openings. By playing 5...a6, Black avoids Bb5+ moves (thus preparing ...e5), while also preparing an eventual ...b5. Black keeps flexibility in the destination of the Nb8, while also maintaining opportunities to play ...e5, ...e6, or ...g6.
Pros:

Positionally sound while also dynamic
Very good for playing for a win
Sharp

Cons:

Very theoretical
White has many dangerous piece sacrifices
Very popular - thus your opponents will be prepared
