The Sicilian Dragon is named for the similarity of its structure to the constellation Draco. Having played 2...d6 and 4...Nf6 (inducing 5.Nc3, blocking the c-pawn) Black continues by fianchettoing the king bishop, which shoots along a strong, long diagonal.
Pros:

Extremely sharp
Unique positions
Great attacking chances for Black

Cons:

Lots of theory
White can try to open the h-file with h4-h5
Black loses control of the d5 square
