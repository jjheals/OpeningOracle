In the Exchange French, White solves the problem of the attack on e4 in the simplest way - by exchanging on d5. This frees the black bishop on c8, but leads to a symmetrical position where White is to move.
Pros:

Safe
Simple
Little knowledge necessary

Cons:

Overly simplistic
Gives up White's potential space advantage In a symmetrical position
White must show their cards first

Famous Practitioners: Garry Kasparov
