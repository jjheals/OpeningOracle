In the Tarrasch variation of the French defense - named after German grandmaster Siegbert Tarrasch - White defends the e4 pawn by 3.Nd2. This looks less active, but avoids the pin 3...Bb4 (after 3.Nc3) and maintains the possibility of supporting d4 by playing c2-c3.
Pros:

Solid
Tries to maintain the grip
Less counterplay for Black

Cons:

Slower development
Black can counterattack in the center with 3...c5
Less attacking chances than after some alternatives
