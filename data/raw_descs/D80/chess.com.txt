
The so-called 'Stockholm' variation against the Gruenfeld involves White developing the bishop to g5. As in the Bf4 lines, White would like to play the solid e3 move, but prefers to develop the bishop first. From g5 the bishop puts pressure on the f6 knight, and - indirectly - the e7 pawn.
Pros:

Simple development
White can sometimes win a pawn on d5 by removing the f6-knight
White hopes to build a solid center

Cons:

White's kingside development is slowed
The bishop may be exposed to moves such as ...Ne4
Black has chances to play on the queenside with moves like ...c5 or ...dxc4
