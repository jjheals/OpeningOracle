Main Variations Of The Danish Gambit
There are three main variations of the Danish Gambit. Black either accepts or declines the pawn sacrifice. If Black accepts the gambit, White can choose one of two main variations.
Danish Gambit Accepted With 4.Bc4
The most popular variation in case Black accepts the gambit is 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4. White offers yet another pawn to develop even quicker, putting pressure on Black's f7-pawn.

If Black takes the b2-pawn, White develops their other bishop with 4.Bxb2, putting even more pressure on Black's kingside.
Danish Gambit Accepted With 4.Nxc3
White can also play the Danish Gambit Accepted by recapturing the pawn on c3 with 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Nxc3. This move recaptures the pawn and develops the queenside knight to a natural square, from where it attacks the center. 

Although slightly more conservative than the line with 3.Bc4, this line is also dangerous for Black if they don't know what to do. White is a pawn down but has a lead in development. White also enjoys open lines for all their minor pieces, while Black is severely underdeveloped. 
Danish Gambit Declined, Sorensen Defense
Black can also refuse the pawn sacrifice and play a safer game with the moves 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 d5. With this move, Black ignores the hanging pawn to open lines for their own pieces. The black pawn on d5 also attacks White's undefended pawn on e4.

The game usually continues with White capturing the d5-pawn. From there, point Black can recapture with 4...Qxd5, since White can't gain a tempo developing their knight to c3, or develop their knight with 4...Nf6.

History Of The Danish Gambit
The Danish Gambit was first analyzed by a Danish player called Blankensteiner in 1830. Later, another Dane player further popularized the opening by employing it in the international tournament of Paris in 1867.
Later, players like Alexander Alekhine, Joseph Henry Blackburne, and Frank Marshall used the opening. However, the gambit fell in popularity around the 1920s, when more players learned how to defend with Black. 
Nowadays, the opening is rare among the chess elite. Yet, you can still see aggressive players employing the Danish Gambit at lower levels.
