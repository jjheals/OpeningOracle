The Caro-Kann Defense is known above all for its solidity. The defining move, 1...c6, is the fourth most popular reply to 1.e4 and nearly twice as common as the number five move. It prepares for 2...d5 without blocking in the light-squared bishop, which is considered the main drawback of its cousin the French Defense (1.e4 e6). A standby for positional players at almost every level, the Caro-Kann was a particular favorite of world champion GM Anatoly Karpov.

Starting Position
The Caro-Kann begins with 1.e4 c6, with most variations continuing 2.d4 d5. Either one of these is usually considered the starting position for the Caro-Kann.

Pros

Sound pawn structure
Free light-squared bishop
Safe and solid

Cons

Less space for black
Slower development
There are many different responses for White

Variations
The Caro-Kann is a somewhat complicated opening with several respected variations. On White's second move, 2.d4 is by far the most common. The main exception to know is the Two Knights Defense (1.e4 c6 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3).

White's third move is where the Caro really branches out. White has no fewer than five popular choices here.


Classical Variation
3.Nc3 is White's most common choice by a narrow margin over 3.e5. Black almost always captures with 3...dxe4, with White making the obvious reply 4.Nxe4. White can also reach these lines with 3.Nd2 when 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 transposes.
From here, the game can go in several respected directions but 4...Bf5 is Black's most popular, and this is the Classical Variation. Black very reasonably develops the light-squared bishop, which is why the move ...e6 has been avoided to this point in the first place. White can, and often does, chase the bishop, but this weakens the kingside.
Karpov Variation
The Karpov Variation is 4...Nd7. It is named after—no surprise here—Anatoly Karpov. Black prepares to develop the other knight to f6, but without having to recapture with a pawn.
That said, this move isn't absolutely necessary, and White is under no obligation to take on f6. In fact, after 5.Nf3 Nf6, White plays 6.Ng3 almost as often as 6.Nxf6 and scores far better with it, in part because the bishop remains boxed in on c8, just by the knight on d7 instead of a pawn on e6.

Almost as common as 4...Nd7 is the immediate 4...Nf6, even though it results in doubled pawns.
4...Nf6 Variations
White can play 5.Ng3 but 5.Nxf6 is the most popular and most challenging move. Black can capture towards the center with 5...gxf6, known as the Bronstein-Larsen Variation (after GMs David Bronstein and Bent Larsen), or away from the center with 5...exf6, the Tartakower Variation (after GM Savielly Tartakower). The former is a more dynamic choice in exchange for a shattered pawn structure. The latter, while obviously also resulting in doubled pawns, is still more solid and less compromised. Both moves are about equally popular.

How to recapture after 5.Nxf6 is mostly a matter of taste and at high levels, each move is played equally often. It is worth noting that 5...exf6 draws 38% of the time vs. only a 27% draw rate for 5...gxf6.

Advance Variation
White does not have to play Nc3 on move three. The aptly named Advance Variation, 3.e5, is White's sharpest and best-scoring continuation. GM Vladimir Kramnik used it to retain his classical world champion title against GM Peter Leko in the 14th and final game of their 2004 match.

The three most popular continuations after 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 all score well despite taking different approaches to the position: 4.Nc3 is the Shirov Variation with the main idea of playing g4 and advancing on the kingside; 4.h4 is the Tal Variation and takes a different path to kingside expansion; and 4.Nf3 is the Short Variation, aiming for a more positional struggle.
Exchange Variation
When White captures on d5, it is known as the Exchange Variation. After the obvious 3...cxd5--if planning on recapturing with the queen, Black should have just played the Scandinavian (1...d5)--White can either play 4.Bd3 or the much sharper 4.c4 (as seen below).
When White plays 4.Bd3 the goal is a quiet game. It is much rarer at higher levels than the other main move because Black gets a good game.

After exchanges on d5, White plays either 4.Bd3 for the Exchange Variation or 4.c4 for the Panov-Botvinnik Attack.

Panov-Botvinnik Attack
The latter of these moves is known as the Panov-Botvinnik Attack, with similar positions to the Queen's Gambit. White usually gets an isolated queen's pawn.
Fantasy Variation
The Fantasy Variation, 3.f3, comes in a clear fifth but the move scores well. White prepares to recapture on e4 with the f-pawn, thus maintaining two pawns in the center instead of just one, a much different pawn structure than Caro players are usually going for.
How to Play Against the Caro-Kann
The Advance Variation scores 43% for White against 30% for Black. The Fantasy Variation, at 44% to 33%, fares almost as well, but much of its value is as a surprise weapon. The Advance Variation, meanwhile, is a move that Black must be prepared for, and it still scores well. It is also very sharp with relatively few draws compared to most Caro-Kann lines.

The position after 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.f3 dxe4 4.fxe4, where White wins a whopping 57% of the time. Black should play either 3...e6 (a move earlier) or the even better-scoring 3...Qb6 instead of 3...dxe4.

Also a surprisingly effective way for White to meet the Caro-Kann is with 2.c4 instead of 2.d4. It may be an even better surprise weapon than the Fantasy Variation, as White still wins 44% of the time but only loses 23%. A lot of times 2.c4 will transpose into the Panov-Botvinnik Attack.
History
The Caro-Kann is named for Horatio Caro and Marcus Kann, two 19th century players who analyzed it. Its first appearance in a published game came between two unknown players in 1845, while the analysis by Caro and Kann came in the 1880s.
Like many openings, the Caro-Kann did not gain much respect until the 20th century. At the 1927 New York tournament, world champion Jose Raul Capablanca used it as his main weapon against 1.e4 and scored two wins with three draws and no losses.

In his 1958 rematch with GM Vassily Smyslov, GM Mikhail Botvinnik became the first player to use the Caro-Kann in a match for the world championship, and he would do so again in both his championship matches against GM Mikhail Tal from 1960-61. GM Tigran Petrosian also used it to defend his title against GM Boris Spassky in 1966.
By then, the Caro-Kann was well established as one of Black's most viable options against 1.e4. GM Magnus Carlsen used it against GM Viswanathan Anand in the 2013 World Championship. The Caro-Kann is currently a favorite of GM Alireza Firouzja.
Famous Games
Of the five times Capablanca played the Caro-Kann at New York 1927, none is more famous than his dismantling of Aron Nimzowitsch's Advance Variation.

Bronstein showed how dangerous his 5...gxf6 variation could be in this win against Nikolay Bakulin in 1965.

The fourth move 4...Nd7 shone in 1973 when Petrosian crushed Tal with it.

Conclusion
The Caro-Kann is a great option for positional players. While some lines can get tactical, the opening is fundamentally solid. Learn more about it with the Chess.com Lesson from GM Sam Shankland or by exploring our Master Games database.

The Caro–Kann Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:

1. e4 c6
The Caro–Kann is a common defence against the King's Pawn Opening. It is classified as a Semi-Open Game, like the Sicilian Defence and French Defence, although it is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than either of those openings. It often leads to good endgames for Black, who has the better pawn structure. It allows Black to circumvent enormous bodies of theory in 1.e4 openings such as the Ruy Lopez and the Sicilian Defence.
Unlike its sister opening, the French Defence, the Caro–Kann does not hinder the development of Black's light-squared bishop. However, it comes at the cost of a tempo because Black has to play 1...c6 before pushing the pawn to c5, whereas Black can push c7–c5 in one move in the French Defence. White can combat the Caro–Kann in several different ways, often gaining a space advantage; additionally, Black has less mobility and can lag in development. 
In the 21st century, grandmasters Vladislav Artemiev and Alireza Firouzja use the opening with regularity, while Ding Liren and Hikaru Nakamura use it on occasion.[citation needed]


History[edit]
Mieses vs. Kann, Hamburg 1885
abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghPosition after 17...Rc1

The opening is named after the English player Horatio Caro and the Austrian player Marcus Kann, both of whom analysed it in 1886. Kann scored an impressive 24-move victory with the Caro–Kann Defence against German-British chess champion Jacques Mieses at the 4th German Chess Congress in Hamburg in May 1885:

1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 4.Bd3 Bxd3 5.Qxd3 e6 6.f4 c5 7.c3 Nc6 8.Nf3 Qb6 9.0-0 Nh6 10.b3 cxd4 11.cxd4 Nf5 12.Bb2 Rc8 13.a3 Ncxd4 14.Nxd4 Bc5 15.Rd1 Nxd4 16.Bxd4 Bxd4+ 17.Qxd4 Rc1 (diagram) 18.Kf2 Rxd1 19.Qxb6 axb6 20.Ke2 Rc1 21.Kd2 Rg1 22.g3 Kd7 23.a4 Rc8 24.b4 Rcc1 0–1[1]

Main line: 2.d4 d5[edit]
After 2.d4 d5 the most common moves are 3.Nc3 (Classical and Modern variations), 3.Nd2, 3.exd5 (Exchange Variation), and 3.e5 (Advance Variation).


3.Nc3 and 3.Nd2[edit]
3.Nc3 and 3.Nd2 usually transpose into each other after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4. Since the 1970s, 3.Nd2 has increased in popularity to avoid the Gurgenidze Variation (3.Nc3 g6) and to retain the option of 4.c3.

Classical Variation: 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 [edit]

abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefgh Classical Variation after 4...Bf5

The most common way of handling the Caro–Kann, the Classical Variation (often referred to as the Capablanca Variation after Cuban grandmaster José Raúl Capablanca), is defined by the moves: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 (or 3.Nd2) dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5. This was long considered to represent best play for both sides in the Caro–Kann. White usually continues: 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 Nd7 8.h5 Bh7 9.Bd3 Bxd3 10.Qxd3. Although White's pawn on h5 looks ready to attack, it can prove to be a weakness in an endgame.[2]
Much of the Caro–Kann's reputation as a solid defence stems from this variation. Black makes very few compromises in pawn structure and plays a timely ...c6–c5 to contest the d4-square. Variations with Black castling queenside gave the Caro–Kann its reputation of being solid but somewhat boring. More popular recently are variations with Black castling kingside and even leaving his king in the centre. These variations can be sharp and dynamic.
Here is a brilliancy illustrating White's attacking chances when the players castle on opposite sides in the Classical Variation:

Lev Milman vs. Joseph Fang, Foxwoods Open 2005 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Bf5 5. Ng3 Bg6 6. h4 h6 7. Nf3 Nd7 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 (10...Qc7 avoids White's next) 11. Bf4 Bb4+ 12. c3 Be7 13. 0-0-0 Ngf6 14. Kb1 0-0 15. Ne5 c5?! (15...Qa5 is usual and better) 16. Qf3 Qb6? (necessary was 16...cxd4 17.Rxd4 Nxe5 18.Bxe5 Qc8 19.Rhd1 Rd8 20.Ne4 with a small White advantage) 17. Nxd7 Nxd7 18. d5 exd5 19. Nf5! Bf6 20. Rxd5 Qe6 21. Bxh6 Ne5 (21...gxh6 22.Rd6 Qe8 23.Rxf6 Nxf6 24.Qg3+ mates on g7) 22. Qe4 Nc6 23. Qf3 Ne5? (23...gxh6 24.Rd6 Qe5 25.Nxh6+ Kg7 26.Nf5+ Kh7 with an unclear position) 24. Qe4 Nc6 25. Qg4! Qxd5 (25...Ne5 26.Rxe5 Qxe5 27.Bxg7 Bxg7 28.h6 wins) 26. Bxg7 Qd3+ 27. Ka1 Ne5 28. Ne7+!! Kh7 29. Qg6+!! fxg6 30. hxg6+ Kxg7 31. Rh7# (White is down a queen, a rook, and a bishop!)[3][4]

Modern Variation: 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7 [edit]

abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefgh Modern Variation: 4...Nd7

Another solid positional line, this variation is characterised by the moves: 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 (or 3.Nd2) dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7. At one time named after the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz, nowadays the variation is variously referred to as the Smyslov Variation after the seventh world champion Vasily Smyslov who played a number of notable games with it; the Karpov Variation, after the twelfth world champion Anatoly Karpov, in whose repertoire it appeared quite often; or, most commonly, the Modern Variation. The short-term goal of 4...Nd7 is to ease development by the early exchange of a pair of knights without compromising the structural integrity of Black's position. Play is similar to the Classical Variation except that Black has more freedom by delaying the development of his bishop, and is not forced to play it to the g6-square. This freedom comes at a cost, however, as White enjoys added freedom in taking up space in the centre, and often plays the aggressive 5.Ng5!? where Black's development is brought into question as well as the positional weakness of the f7-square. The famous last game of the Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov rematch where Kasparov committed a known blunder and lost was played in this very line.
Specialist knowledge is a must to play this opening. Otherwise Black could fall prey to early attacks such as the quick mating trap for White, 5.Qe2 followed by 6.Nd6#.


3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nf6 5.Nxf6+[edit]

Bronstein–Larsen Variation: 5...gxf6 [edit]

abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefgh Bronstein–Larsen Variation: 5...gxf6!?

Black has voluntarily opted for an inferior pawn structure and a practical necessity of castling queenside, while gaining dynamic compensation in the form of the open g-file for the rook and unusually active play for the Caro–Kann. It is generally considered somewhat unsound, though world championship challenger David Bronstein and former world championship candidate Bent Larsen employed it with some success.


Korchnoi (or Tartakower) Variation: 5...exf6 [edit]

abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefgh Korchnoi/Tartakower Variation: 5...exf6

Viktor Korchnoi played 5...exf6 many times (including his first world championship match with Anatoly Karpov), and this line has also been employed by Ulf Andersson. Black's 5...exf6 is regarded as sounder than 5...gxf6!? of the Bronstein–Larsen Variation and offers Black rapid development, though also ceding White the superior pawn structure and long-term prospects (Black has to be cautious that the d-pawn is now a potential passed pawn in the endgame).


Gurgenidze Variation: 3.Nc3 g6 [edit]

abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghGurgenidze Variation: 3...g6

The Gurgenidze Variation is 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 g6. Black prepares to fianchetto the bishop on g7, creating pressure against White's d4-pawn. After 4.Nf3 Bg7 White usually plays 5.h3 to prevent the ...Bg4 pin. This variation, originated by Bukhuti Gurgenidze, led to a rise in the popularity of 3.Nd2 during the 1970s. After 3.Nd2, 3...g6 is met by 4.c3, when the fianchettoed bishop has little to do because of a dark squared pawn chain. 3.Nd2 will usually transpose into the Classical Variation after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4.


Advance Variation: 3.e5 [edit]

abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghAdvance Variation with 3...Bf5

The 3...Bf5 variation that follows 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 Bf5 has gained popularity after having previously been widely regarded as inferior for many years, owing chiefly to the strategic demolition that Aron Nimzowitsch (playing as White) suffered at the hands of José Capablanca in one of their games at the New York 1927 tournament.[5]
The Advance Variation has since been revitalized by aggressive lines such as the Bayonet Attack (4.Nc3 e6 5.g4), a popular line in the 1980s and later favoured by Latvian grandmaster Alexei Shirov, or the less ambitious variation 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 c5 6.Be3, popularised by English grandmaster Nigel Short and often seen in the 1990s. Another less popular but aggressive line is the Tal variation (4.h4 h5), popularised by grandmaster Mikhail Tal.



abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefghAdvance Variation with 3...c5

The 3...c5 variation that follows 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.e5 c5!? is an important alternative and avoids the weight of theory associated with 3...Bf5. It was used by Mikhail Botvinnik in his 1961 match versus Mikhail Tal (though with a negative outcome for Botvinnik – two draws and a loss). The line was christened the "Arkell/Khenkin Variation" in the leading chess magazine New in Chess yearbook 42 in recognition of the work these two grandmasters did and the success they were having with the variation. In comparison to the French Defence, Black lacks the tempo normally spent on 1...e6; however, White can only exploit this by the weakening of his own central bind with 4.dxc5 when Black has good chances of regaining the pawn.


Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 cxd5 [edit]
The Exchange Variation is 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 cxd5.

Main line: 4.Bd3[edit]

abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefgh Exchange Variation with 4.Bd3

The Exchange Variation begins with 4.Bd3 (to prevent ...Bf5 while still developing) 4...Nc6 5.c3 Nf6 6.Bf4 Bg4 7.Qb3. This line is considered to offer White a slightly better game and was tried by Bobby Fischer. Some of the strategic ideas are analogous to the Queen's Gambit Declined, Exchange Variation, (1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5) with colours reversed.


Panov–Botvinnik Attack: 4.c4 [edit]

abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefgh Panov–Botvinnik Attack

The Panov–Botvinnik Attack begins with the move 4.c4. It is named after Vasily Panov and the world champion Mikhail Botvinnik. This system often leads to typical isolated queen's pawn (IQP) positions, with White obtaining rapid development, a grip on e5, and kingside attacking chances to compensate for the long-term structural weakness of the isolated d4-pawn. The major variation in this line is 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nf3, when Black's main alternatives are 6...Bb4 (a position often transposing into lines of the Nimzo-Indian Defence) and 6...Be7, once the most common line. 6...Nc6?! is inferior as it is favourably met by 7.c5!, after which White plans on seizing the e5-square by advancing the b-pawn to b5, or by exchanging the black knight on c6 after Bb5.


Fantasy Variation: 3.f3 [edit]
The Fantasy Variation, formerly known as the Tartakower or Maroçzy variation, 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.f3, somewhat resembles the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit. 3...e6 is probably the most solid response, preparing to exploit the dark squares via ...c5, though 3....g6 has been tried by Yasser Seirawan. GM Lars Schandorff and GM Sam Shankland both prefer 3...dxe4 4.fxe4 e5 5.Nf3 Bg4 6.Bc4 Nd7 7.0-0 Ngf6 8.c3 Bd6 with play being sharp and double-edged, though recent theory suggest that 7.c3! is more critical, giving a small objective advantage for White. Interesting, though probably insufficient is 3...e5. This so-called 'Twisted Fantasy Variation' aims to exploit White's weaknesses on the a7–g1 diagonal, an idea similar to 3...Qb6, a variation championed by Baadur Jobava. Related to the Fantasy Variation are the gambits 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.f3, originated by Sir Stuart Milner-Barry, and 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Bc4 Nf6 5.f3  (von Hennig).

Two Knights Variation: 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) [edit]

abcdefgh8877665544332211abcdefgh Two Knights Variation

The Two Knights Variation 1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Nf3 (or 2.Nf3 d5 3.Nc3) was played by Bobby Fischer in his youth, but has since declined in popularity. White's intention is to benefit from rapid development as well as to retain options regarding the d-pawn. Black's logical and probably best reply is 3...Bg4. After 4.h3 Bxf3 5.Qxf3, the positional continuation, Black has the option of 5...Nf6 or 5...e6. The Retreat Line 4...Bh5 is playable but Black must be careful. In Noteboom–Mindeno 1927 Black lost quickly after 5.exd5 cxd5 6.g4 Bg6 7.Ne5 a6? (7...Nc6 is necessary) 8.h4 d4 9.h5! dxc3 10.hxg6 cxd2+ 11.Qxd2 Qxd2+ 12.Bxd2 and Black must lose material.[6]
This variation sets a trap: playing along the lines of the Classical Variation gets Black in trouble after 3...dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 (4...Nd7 is playable) 5.Ng3 Bg6?! (5...Bg4) 6.h4 h6 7.Ne5 Bh7 (7...Qd6 may be best) 8.Qh5! g6 (forced) 9.Bc4! e6 (9...gxh5?? 10.Bxf7#) 10.Qe2 with a huge advantage for White. Now 10...Qe7! is best. Instead, Lasker–Radsheer, 1908 and Alekhine–Bruce, 1938 ended quickly after, respectively, 10...Bg7?? 11.Nxf7! and 10...Nf6?? 11.Nxf7![7][8]
After the moves 1.e4 c6 2.Nc3 d5 3.Qf3!? (Goldman Variation), White's position is sound according to Graham Burgess.[9]


Other lines[edit]
The percentage white wins, black wins or a draw occurs in the games of highly rated players (2200+ FIDE) in four lines of the Caro–Kann Defence.[10]
2.c4, the Accelerated Panov Attack, is an effective move for White. Black will probably play 2...d5 (see 1.e4 c6 2.c4 d5). This can transpose to the Panov–Botvinnik (B14, given above, with 3.exd5 cxd5 4.d4) or Caro–Kann (B10, with the double capture on d5). Alternatively, Black may play 2...e5, the Open Variation (see 1.e4 c6 2.c4 e5). The 2.c4 line can also arise by transposition from the English Opening: 1.c4 c6 2.e4.
The Hillbilly Attack,[11][12] 1.e4 c6 2.Bc4?!, is most often played by weaker players unfamiliar with the Caro–Kann Defence. If 2...d5 3.exd5 cxd5, Black has simply gained a tempo on the bishop. Nevertheless, GM Simon Williams has experimented with this move, following it up by gambiting the pawn with 2...d5 3.Bb3!?[13]
An interesting, relatively unknown try is 1. e4 c6 2. Nf3 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Ne5!?, sometimes referred to as the Apocalypse Attack. Despite its oddity, this line carries a deceptive amount of venom, e.g. 4...Bf5? immediately runs into trouble after 5. Bb5+, when Black must lose a tempo and the bishop pair with 5...Bd7 (5..Nd7?? 6. Qf3 is disastrous for Black). The game can continue with 6. Qh5 g6 7. Nxd7! Nxd7 (7...gxh5?? 8. Nf6#) 8. Qxd5, where white wins a pawn and enjoys a strong initiative. This variation is similar to the traditional Exchange Caro-Kann (in which playing Ne5 is one of White's goals) with the added benefit that the pin with ...Bg4 has been sidestepped entirely. After 3...Nc6, White may proceed with d4 and Bb5, responding to ...Qb6 with c4 (the Neo-Panov-Botvinnik Attack) and to ...Bd7 with Nxd7 to acquire the two bishops, or he may play in a Stonewall fashion with d4, c3, Bd3, and f4 in some order. While 3...e6 is a perfectly acceptable Black response--and appears to be the most often played--the response 3...g6! is critical, allowing Black flexibility in fighting for e5.[14]
Other lines are ineffective or doubtful. These include 2.d3, the Breyer Variation; 2.b3, the Euwe Attack; 2.b4, the Labahn Attack; 2.g4, the Spike Variation; and 2.Ne2, the Bohemian Attack. 
White's response to the Caro–Kann, on the 3rd move can keep win/loss/draw chances (with d4 or Nc3, refer to image right) or increase draw chances (with c3). The worst response by white to the Caro–Kann defence is g3.
