
In playing 3.e5 in the Caro-Kann, White gains a space advantage by creating a pawn chain into Black's half of the board. With the center locked, the position slows down, and either side can play on both sides of the board in a very complex strategic situation, although there are some sharp attacking lines for White as well.
Pros:

Advantage in space
Gain of time compared to the Advance French
Non-forcing play

Cons:

Sometimes more closed than 1.e4 players would like
Black's Bc8 is free (compared to Advance French)

Famous Practitioners: Nigel Short, Alexei Shirov
