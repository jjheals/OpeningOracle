With the "Brinckmann Attack" against the Gruenfeld (usually just referred to as 'Bf4'), White prepares to develop with e3 without blocking in the bishop. This is a fairly safe way to combat the Gruenfeld Defense, since White forgoes the creation of a big pawn center.
Pros:

A safe answer to the Gruenfeld
White aims for some pressure on the queenside
The bishop aims at some important squares

Cons:

White's kingside development is slowed Black can hit back with ...c5
The c4-pawn is unguarded, so Black can capture it
