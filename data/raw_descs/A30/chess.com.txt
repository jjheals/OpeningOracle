
A symmetrical response to the English opening is possible - 1.c4 c5. Black blocks the c-pawn and controls d4. This could result in many different structures, depending on whether one side decides to push their d-pawn two squares.
Pros:

Safe
Fights for d4 from the side

Cons:

Symmetrical position with a tempo less
May be drawish
Does not unbalance the game very much
