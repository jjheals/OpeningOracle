In the Winawer French, Black immediately pins the Nc3 with the dark-squared bishop, putting additional pressure on e4. This often results in the bishop being traded, creating an imbalance of White's doubled pawns versus the two bishops advantage.
Pros:

Sharp
Unusual
Aggressive

Cons:

Risky
White's attacking chances
Black's passive Bc8
Black's weak dark squares
