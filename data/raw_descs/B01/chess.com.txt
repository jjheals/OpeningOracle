With the Modern variation of the Scandinavian Black prepares to recapture on d5 with the knight rather than the queen. This way a less-valuable piece will be on the exposed square in the center.
Pros:

Black does not lose time with the queen (compared to 2...Qxd5)
Black has free play with his pieces

Cons:

The knight moves twice to capture on d5
The knight can be chased by c2-c4
White gains space in the center
