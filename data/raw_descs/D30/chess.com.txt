
By hitting back in the center right away with 4...c5, Black is creating a great battle there - having waited until after the knight came to f6, Black is ready to recapture on d5 with the knight. This can lead to more simplification than the 'normal' Tarrasch.
Pros:

Solid opening
Positional
Open, free play

Cons:

White can create a big center
Lots of simplification
Rather one-dimensional
