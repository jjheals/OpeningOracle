In the Three Knights Variation against the Gruenfeld, White uses the move 5.Qb3 to force Black to exchange on c4, thus giving White a strong pawn center after a subsequent e2-e4.
Pros:

Black does not get a chance to exchange a pair of knights

Cons:

The queen moves several times
White's center can be very exposed
White delays the kingside development
