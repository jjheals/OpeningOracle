The Evans Gambit - named after Captain William Davies Evans, who first played it in 1827 - is a pawn sacrifice. White gambits the b4 pawn to gain time attacking the black piece which captures it, and take over the center with c2-c3 and d2-d4.
Pros:

Aggressive
Attacking
Dangerous

Cons:

Black is up a pawn
Several good defenses have been worked out
The gambit can be safely declined
