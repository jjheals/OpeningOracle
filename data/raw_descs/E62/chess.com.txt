The Fianchetto Variation against the King's Indian combines the fianchetto of the white king's-bishop with the moves c4 and d4. White usually holds back on the move e2-e4, and the bishop on g2 helps to keep the king safe.
Pros:

More long-term pressure
Solid
Less direct attacking chances for Black

Cons:

The c4-pawn is not supported
White's center is not so threatening
Black may gain strong counterplay on the long-diagonal
