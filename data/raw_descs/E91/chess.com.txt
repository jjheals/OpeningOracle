In the Orthodox Variation against the King's Indian, White creates a three-pawn center and develops his kingside naturally. Generally after a later ...e5 White will create a pawn wedge with d4-d5, followed by queenside play. The opposing pawn chains create spheres of influence on opposite sides of the board.
Pros:

Sound play
Gives White a space advantage
White can get a strong attack on the queenside

Cons:

The white king can come under great attack
Very theoretical
