In the Leningrad variation of the Dutch, Black combines the ...f5 move with a fianchetto of the king's bishop. In this way, Black might be hoping to reach an 'ideal' King's Indian Defense, where the f5-pawn battles for control of the center.
Pros:

Sharp
Unbalanced
Very flexible, little theory

Cons:

The e6-square becomes weak after a later ...d6
Black's castled position is less secure, with the f5-pawn advanced
