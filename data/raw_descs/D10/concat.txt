The Slav Defense is a solid opening for Black in response to White's Queen's Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4). Black fights for equality against one of White's most popular openings without creating a bad light-squared bishop—one of the downsides of other defenses like the French Defense and the Queen's Gambit Declined.
An extremely popular opening which has been endorsed by many world champions such as GMs Max Euwe, Mikhail Botvinnik, Vladimir Kramnik, Viswanathan Anand, and Magnus Carlsen. Usually leading to slower games, the Slav is a good choice for players at any level.

Conclusion

Starting Position
The Slav Defense starts after the moves 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6. Black avoids taking White's c4-pawn to keep their firm grasp of the center, particularly the e4-square. The characteristic 2...c6 supports the d5-pawn while not locking the light-squared bishop inside the pawn chain as it happens in other openings such as the French Defense and Queen's Gambit Declined.

The Slav Defense starting position.

Of course, there's a downside to the move 2...c6. The c7-c6 pawn push doesn't help develop any pieces, and the pawn blocks the knight's most natural development square.
Pros

The c8-bishop has a free diagonal to develop.
Black maintains a solid central point.
Black might capture the c4-pawn.

Cons

Black's development is slower.
Hitting back with ...c5 will lose a move.
The c6-pawn blocks the natural development square of the knight.

Variations
As with most of the other major openings among grandmasters, the Slav has an extensive theory. The three variations listed below are by far the most popular:
Main Line
The main line of the Slav Defense results in a balanced position. Both sides have a multitude of options as to how to conduct the game.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.a4 Bf5 6.e3 e6 7.Bxc4

Modern Line, Quiet Variation
By playing the Quiet Variation of the Modern Line, White can avoid learning heavy theory. White gets a good position out of the opening by relying on simple development and a solid pawn structure.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3

Semi-Slav
Despite being a variation of the Slav, the Semi-Slav branches out from standard Slav theory and can be considered a different opening. The Semi-Slav is the second most popular option for Black and it often leads to closed positions.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 e6

Chameleon (Chebanenko Slav)
The Chameleon Variation is the second most popular choice for Black after 4...dxc4. This system is very flexible, as multiple pawn structures may arise from this variation. Black plays 4...a6 to support the b5-square.
1.d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 a6





Exchange Variation
The Exchange Variation is the most uneventful line of the Slav Defense despite its immense popularity. Of the more than 4,600 games with this line in our database, 65% of them ended in a draw. The positions in this variation are very symmetrical, with little chance for either of the players to create serious threats. The most popular continuation of this line sees both players exchanging their pieces and reaching a drawn position.
Even though the results aren't compelling, the Exchange Variation is the simplest way of playing against the Slav and retains the initiative of having the first move as White.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.cxd5

How To Play Against The Slav Defense
White usually scores well against the Slav Defense, which is good news for the Queen's Gambit player. The move 2...c6 is the most popular response to 2.c4, despite White winning 40% of games, drawing 39%, and losing only 21%.
Below you can learn two of the best scoring variations against the main line and the Chameleon, by far the two variations that Black chooses most often.
Bled Attack
The Bled Attack is a great way to fight against the main line of the Slav. White plays 6.Nh4 to threaten Black's light-squared bishop, and Black can already go wrong in a few different ways in this position. White wins 48% of the time, draws 32%, and loses 20% when employing this variation.
This line is particularly interesting since the Slav player usually wants to put their light-squared bishop to good use, and the Bled Attack makes this harder to achieve.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 dxc4 5.a4 Bf5 6.Nh4


Modern Line, Quiet Variation
The Quiet Variation of the Modern Line is probably the most straightforward way of playing against the Slav. White plays 4.e3 to build strong central control and develops naturally to get a good position. Particularly interesting is the line where White develops the light-squared bishop to d3 and the b1-knight to d2. White wins 49% of the games, draws 37%, and loses a mere 13% of the games in this line.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 e6 5.Bd3 Nbd7 6.Nbd2


Chameleon With 5.c5
Against the Chameleon variation, engines and masters endorse the move 5.c5. White punishes Black for weakening the b6-square (after pushing both the a and c-pawns). Black can fight back, but the positions that arise in this line are usually easier for White to play, with more space and straightforward plans. White wins 41% of the games in this variation, draws 34%, and loses only 24%.
1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 a6 5.c5

History Of The Slav Defense
The Slav Defense is a relatively new opening, despite being a tremendously popular response to the common Queen's Gambit. Chess master Semyon Alapin started developing the theory for the opening—leading to the Alapin Variation, the main line of the Slav.
The opening gained traction after Euwe and Alexander Alekhine used it extensively in their two world championship matches. Since then, many of the world's strongest players have adopted the opening, such as GMs Anand, Kramnik, and Carlsen.
Famous Games
Many players opted for the Slav during their careers. If you want to learn more about this opening, you can study the games of Euwe, Alekhine, Anand, and Kramnik. Below you can see two famous games with the Slav Defense:
Euwe vs. Alekhine, 1937

GM Veselin Topalov vs. Kramnik, 2006

The Slav Defense is a chess opening that begins with the moves: 

1. d4 d5
2. c4 c6
The Slav is one of the primary defenses to the Queen's Gambit. Although it was analyzed as early as 1590, it was not until the 1920s that it started to be explored extensively, although Steinitz essayed it in the first official World Chess Championship of 1886. Many masters of Slavic descent helped develop the theory of this opening, including Alapin, Alekhine, Bogoljubov, and Vidmar.
The Slav received an exhaustive test during the two Alekhine–Euwe World Championship matches in 1935 and 1937. Played by 11 of the first 13 world champions, this defense was particularly favored by Euwe, Botvinnik, and Smyslov. More recently the Slav has been adopted by Anand, Ivanchuk, Lautier, Short, and other top grandmasters, including use in six of the eight games that Vladimir Kramnik played as Black in the 2006 World Championship (in the other two, he played the related Semi-Slav Defense).
Today the theory of the Slav is very extensive and well-developed.


General considerations[edit]
There are three main variations of the Slav:

The "Pure" Slav or Main Line Slav where Black attempts to develop the light-squared bishop to f5 or g4.
The a6 Slav or Chebanenko Slav with 4...a6.
The Semi-Slav with ...e6 (without developing the light-squared bishop). The Semi-Slav Defense, a kind of a combination Queen's Gambit Declined and Slav Defense, is a very complex opening in its own right.
There is also a lesser option, the Schlechter Slav with ...g6
Black faces two major problems in many variations of the Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD):

Development of his queen bishop is difficult, as it is often blocked by a black pawn on e6.
The pawn structure offers White targets, especially the possibility of a minority attack on the queenside in the QGD Exchange Variation.
The "Pure" Slav and a6 Slav address these problems. Black's queen bishop is unblocked; the pawn structure remains balanced. Also, if Black later takes the gambit pawn with ...dxc4, the support provided by the pawn on c6 (and possibly ...a6) allows ...b5 which may threaten to keep the pawn, or drive away a white piece that has captured it, gaining Black a tempo for queenside expansion. On the other hand, Black usually will not be able to develop the queen bishop without first giving up the center with ...dxc4, developing the bishop may leave the black queenside weak, and the thematic break ...c5 incurs the loss of a tempo.
The Slav can be entered by many move orders. The possibilities include 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.c4 c6, 1.Nf3 d5 2.c4 c6 3.d4 Nf6, and so on.

Alternatives to 3.Nf3[edit]
The main line is 3.Nf3. White can also try the following alternatives:

3.e3[edit]
Black often plays 3...Nf6 but 3...Bf5 is considered to be an easier equalizer. Also, 3...Nf6 4.Nc3 (same as 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.e3 below) may give Black some move-order issues for those wanting to play the "Pure" Slav and not the Semi-Slav or ...a6 Slav.

Exchange Slav: 3.cxd5 [edit]
The Exchange Variation was once described as "the system that takes the fun out of playing the Slav" for Black.[1] After 3.cxd5 cxd5, the symmetrical position offers White only the advantage of the extra move, but the drawish position offers Black little chance to win unless White is overly ambitious. The rooks will often be exchanged down the now open c-file. This line is often used as a drawing weapon and if both players want to draw, they can play the symmetrical line, which continues 3...cxd5 4.Nf3 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bf4 Bf5, resulting in a totally symmetrical position where every piece is developed to a good square. To avoid the possibility of the Exchange Slav Black often chooses the move order 2...e6 followed by 3...c6 to enter the Semi-Slav, this is known as the Triangle System.

3.Nc3[edit]
The pressure on Black's center prevents 3...Bf5? since after 4.cxd5 cxd5 5.Qb3 White wins a pawn. Black can try the Winawer Countergambit, 3...e5, which was introduced in Marshall–Winawer, Monte Carlo 1901 but this is thought to be slightly better for White. The most common continuation is 3...Nf6 when 4.Nf3 transposes to the main line. White can also play 4.e3 when it was thought Black could no longer play the "Pure" Slav with 4...Bf5 (and had to choose between 4...e6 or 4...a6) due to 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Qb3. Therefore, "Pure" Slav players sometimes meet 3.Nc3 with 3...dxc4, the Argentinian Defense, which can transpose to the main line of the "Pure" Slav. Recently the Gambit 4...Bf5 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Qb3 Nc6 7.Qxb7 Bd7 has revitalized 4...Bf5.

3.Nf3 introduction[edit]
Black usually plays 3...Nf6. 3...e6 may lead to various possibilities, such as the Noteboom Variation, Semi-Slav Defense or Stonewall Dutch. 3...Bf5? is a mistake due to 4.cxd5 cxd5 5.Qb3, where black must play 5...Bc8 to avoid losing the b-pawn. Attempts such as 5...b6? fail due to e.g 6.Bg5 e6 7.e4! dxe4 8.Bb5+ Nbd7 9. Ne5 with 10.Bxf6 to follow.[citation needed]

Alternatives to 4.Nc3[edit]
After 3...Nf6, the main line is 4.Nc3. White can also try the following alternatives:

4.Qc2 or 4.Qb3[edit]
A line that is similar to the Catalan Opening is 4.Qc2 or 4.Qb3. Often, White will fianchetto his light-square bishop. This has the disadvantage of White's queen being somewhat exposed on c2. Black can meet 4.Qc2 with 4...g6, intending 5...Bf5. White usually plays 5.Bf4 so that after 5...Bf5 6.Qb3 Qb6 White can play 7.c5! Black has to play 7...Qxb3, which will be met by 8.axb3. White has a moderate advantage in this queenless middlegame, as White can expand on the queenside and try to create play on the queenside, but Black's position is solid. The most common continuations are 4...dxc4 5.Qxc4 Bf5 or 5...Bg4.

4.g3[edit]
Another Catalan style approach is 4.g3.

Slow Slav: 4.e3 [edit]
White can avoid the complexities of the main line 4.Nc3 by playing 4.e3. The most common continuation is 4...Bf5 5.Nc3 e6 6.Nh4, when White wins the bishop pair but Black gets a solid position and often gets counterplay with ...e5. This line was tested several times in the 2006 World Chess Championship. Alternatively, 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Qb3 Qc7 is fine for Black.  White will try to take advantage of the absence of Black's queen bishop on the queenside, but this isn't enough to gain an advantage if Black plays accurately. Another way to play is 4...Bg4.

4.Nc3 introduction[edit]
While 4...Bf5 is playable, it is not the best choice for Black, because White will gain the advantage with either 5.Qb3 or 5.cxd5 followed by 6.Qb3. Traditionally Black had a choice between 4...e6, the Semi-Slav, and 4...dxc4 before developing the queen bishop, but in the 1990s 4...a6 was introduced, with the idea of developing the queenside without locking in the queen bishop or conceding the center.

a6 (Chebanenko) Slav: 4...a6 [edit]
The a6 Slav occurs after 4...a6. Black seeks an early b5, either before or after capturing at c4.
White can achieve an important space advantage with 5.c5.  Both e5 and b6 become important pawn breaks for Black.  White will often play his bishop to f4, controlling the important dark squares e5, d6, c7, and b8 (this last square reduces Black's control over the b-file should it open).  The game can continue 5...Bf5 6.Bf4 Nbd7 7.e3 Nh5!.[2]

4...dxc4 – alternatives to 5.a4[edit]
After 4...dxc4, the main line is 5.a4. White can also try the following alternatives

Slav Geller Gambit: 5.e4 [edit]
White's sharpest try against 4...dxc4 is the Slav Geller Gambit, 5.e4. Play usually continues 5...b5 6.e5 Nd5 7.a4 e6, but it is unclear whether the attack is strong enough for the sacrificed pawn. Evaluation of this line changes as improvements are found, but as of 2005 it is generally thought to favor Black.

White maintains the pawn with 5.e3[edit]
5.e3 is a solid choice known as the Alekhine Variation. Play can proceed 5...b5 6.a4 b4

7.Na2 e6 8.Bxc4
7.Nb1 Ba6 8.Nbd2 c3 9.bxc3 Bxf1 10.Nxf1 bxc3
Alapin Variation: 5.a4; alternatives to 5...Bf5 [edit]
With 5.a4, White acts against ...b5 and prepares 6.e4 and 7.Bxc4. Black's main move is 5...Bf5. Black can also try the following alternatives:

Steiner Variation: 5...Bg4 [edit]
In the Steiner Variation (also called the Bronstein Variation), 5...Bg4, White may be discouraged from e4 by the possibility 6.e4 e5. More often the game continues 6.Ne5 Bh5.

Smyslov Variation: 5...Na6 [edit]
With the Smyslov Variation, 5...Na6, Black allows the e-pawn to come to e4 but can gain counterplay by ...Bg4 and perhaps bringing the knight to b4 e.g. 6.e4 Bg4 7.Bxc4 e6 8.0-0 Nb4.

Soultanbéieff Variation: 5...e6 [edit]
Main line, Czech Variation: 5...Bf5 [edit]
The Czech Variation can be considered the main line. With 5...Bf5, Black prevents 6.e4.

Bled Attack: 6.Nh4 [edit]
Dutch Variation: 6.e3 [edit]
If White plays 6.e3, the Dutch Variation, play can continue 6...e6 7.Bxc4 Bb4 8.0-0 0-0 with a fairly quiet game. Black can also play 6...Na6 with the idea of 7...Nb4, known as the Dutch, Lasker Variation.

Krause Attack: 6.Ne5 [edit]
A more energetic line begins 6.Ne5 (Krause Attack) where White intends f2–f3 and e2–e4 or Nxc4, perhaps followed by a fianchetto of the king bishop with g2–g3 and Bg2. Black can try either 6...Nbd7 7.Nxc4 Qc7 8.g3 e5 (known as the Carlsbad Variation) or 7...Nb6 or 6...e6 7.f3 Bb4, when 8.e4 Bxe4 9.fxe4 Nxe4 is a complex piece sacrifice with the semi-forced continuation 10.Bd2 Qxd4 11.Nxe4 Qxe4+ 12.Qe2 Bxd2+ 13.Kxd2 Qd5+ 14.Kc2 Na6. White can also play 10.Qf3 and force a draw.
