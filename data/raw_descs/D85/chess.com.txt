
The Exchange Variation of the Gruenfeld is considered one of White's most critical attempts. Since the d5 pawn is not defended by another pawn, White is able to capture it and remove Black's central pawn, leaving White able to build a strong pawn center, which Black tries to pressure with pieces.
Pros:

White builds a big center
White might get attacking chances

Cons:

It can be hard to maintain White's center
Black will get active piece play
Black can get counterplay on the queenside
