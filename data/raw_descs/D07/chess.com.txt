
The Chigorin Defense to the Queen's gambit - introduced by Mikhail Chigorin - seeks to create a position where piece pressure challenges the white center. Black does not support d5 with another pawn, but instead concentrates on rapid development.
Pros:

Black gets free piece play
The white center comes under pressure
Black often doubles the white pawns

Cons:

The knight blocks the c-pawn
White may conquer the center
Black is often required to give up the two bishops
