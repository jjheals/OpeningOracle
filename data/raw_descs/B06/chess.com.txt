
In this fancifully-named opening, Black takes the "dark-square strategy" to its logical limit. The black bishop is fianchettoed and the flank blow ...c5 strives to break open the diagonal.
Pros:

Unusual
Little theory
Sharp and aggressive

Cons:

After 4.dxc5 Black can have trouble getting the pawn back
Black is often required to give up the two bishops by ...Bxc3+
White can choose to lead the game into a Dragon or a Benoni
