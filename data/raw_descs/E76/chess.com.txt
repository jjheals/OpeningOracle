
Originally considered almost a refutation of the King's Indian, the Four Pawns Attack creates a huge pawn center ranging from the c-file to the f-file. White seeks to run Black over by his central pawns, but in practice Black can easily break up the pawns, and the game settles down into some other kind of structure.
Pros:

Very aggressive
White may gain a strong attack
Game often transposes into a sharp variation of the Benoni

Cons:

White's center is very unwieldy
White's king position is exposed
White's development is slower
