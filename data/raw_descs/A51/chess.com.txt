The shocking move 2...e5 - placing a pawn where it is undefended and can be captured with a subsequent attack on the black Nf6 - is known as the Budapest Defense, or Budapest Gambit. Black displaces the d4 pawn, hoping to develop rapidly and regain the pawn on e5.
Pros:

Tricky
Unusual
Considered to be basically sound

 Cons:

Black has to waste time getting the pawn back
White generally emerges with at least some space advantage
White can also often get the two bishops
