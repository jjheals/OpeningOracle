In the Torre Attack, White combines the early Nf3 and Bg5 moves, delaying or avoiding c2-c4. This way White develops the pieces actively while maintaining a solid center - and idea opening for those who like active play, but do not want to deal with a lot of theory.
Pros:

The bishop on g5 pins the Nf6
White maintains a solid d4-point
Natural play with little heavy theory

Cons:

The bishop on g5 can sometimes be traded off
Does not put Black under a lot of immediate pressure
