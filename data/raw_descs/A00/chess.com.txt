Sometimes called the Hungarian Opening, 1.g3 prepares to fianchetto the king's-bishop (Bg2), from which spot it will strike through the center. The delay of Nf3 leads to certain subtleties compared to the King's Indian attack.
Pros:

Positional
May lead to queenside pressure
Flexible

Cons:

The e5 square is not controlled (compared to 1.Nf3, 2.g3)
Black may blot out the bishop by ...d5 and ...c6
Black can create a big center
