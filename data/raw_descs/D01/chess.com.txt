The Veresov Attack is not the typical 1.d4-opening. White goes for fast development and often the players castle on opposite sides of the board. White's play revolves around the e4-square - often he tries to push through e2-e4.
Pros:

Unusual
May lead to an attack
Provocative

Cons:

Blocks the c-pawn
May allow a ...Bb4 pin
Risky
