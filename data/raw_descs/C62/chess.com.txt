A very solid defense, named after the first World Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz. Black defends the e-pawn and prepares to possibly break the pin with ...Bd7.
Pros:

Black maintains a strong-point in the center
Black can either break the pin with ...Bd7 or create his own pin with ...Bg4

Cons:

Blocks in the Bishop on f8
White can immediately attack the center with 4.d4
The kingside development is a little slow
