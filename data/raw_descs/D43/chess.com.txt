
The Semi-Slav meets the Queen's gambit by playing both ...e6 and ...c6. Black then can complete his development and gain the chance for a later ...dxc4 followed by ...b5 and ...Bb7.
Pros:

Sharp, but with solid foundations
Focuses on the center

Cons:

The light-squared bishop is temporarily blocked
Very theoretical
Can be avoided in various ways
