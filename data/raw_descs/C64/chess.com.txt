One of the oldest defenses against the Ruy Lopez - Black develops the bishop to a diagonal which is typical of the Italian Game. He delays the development of the king's-knight, and might end up using this to play ...Nge7, ...Qf6, or ...f5.
Pros:

The bishop aims at f2
The f-pawn and d8-h4 diagonal (for the queen) are left unblocked
Black develops rapidly

Cons:

The bishop can be attacked by c3 and d4
The 'fork trick' (Nxe5 Nxe5 d4) becomes possible
The bishop leaves the black kingside with less defenders
