The Modern Defense to the King's Gambit operates by the principle of accepting the gambit and then returning the pawn while hitting back in the center. Usually White gets the gambit pawn back in this variation, but in the meantime Black destroys most of White's central superiority.
Pros:

A pretty safe defense for Black
Black gets free development
The white king is often less safe

Cons:

White usually gets the pawn back
Winning the f4 pawn gives White the open f-file
White can get a lead in development
