Black does not have to play into the hands of the bold King's Gambiteer. Instead, he can refuse the pawn while developing the bishop to a square which prevents White from castling.
Pros:

Avoids the messiness of the King's Gambit Accepted
Prevents castling by White
Develops a piece

Cons:

Allows White to get away with the space gaining flank blow f2-f4
White can later open the f-file for attack
The bishop on c5 can later be exchanged by Na4
