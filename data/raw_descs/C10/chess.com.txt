By capturing on e4 (which can be played by Black after either 3.Nc3 or 3.Nd2) Black clears the center and allows fairly smooth development. Against this, they grant White a space advantage in a simple position, which Black tries to eventually neutralize.
Pros:

Safe
Simple play
Avoiding much risk

 Cons:

Space disadvantage
Limited chances for Black to win
Passive
