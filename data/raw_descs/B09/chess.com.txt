The starting position of the Austrian Attack.

The immediate 4.f4 allows White to develop their kingside knight behind the pawn chain, giving White's central pawns more mobility. With this, White can later strike in the center more effectively.
Pros

White can get a dangerous attack against Black
White often manages to shut out the fianchettoed bishop by playing e4-e5.

Cons

White weakens his king position slightly by playing f4
The Austrian Attack allows Black the kind of sharp game that Pirc players prefer

Main Variations Of The Austrian Attack
After White enters the Austrian Attack, there are a few ways the game can continue. However, players must know the two critical variations below if they're willing to play this opening.
Austrian Attack With 5...O-O
The main line of the Austrian Attack happens after the moves 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.f4 Bg7 5.Nf3 O-O 6.Bd3. Black fianchettoes their dark-squared bishop and castles, letting White build a strong center and develop their kingside pieces.

Black will usually develop their knight to either c6 or a6. If Black plays 6...Nc6, one of the players usually strikes quickly in the center with a pawn push. After 6...Na6, Black will usually play for ...c5 and then reroute the knight to c7, possibly expanding on the queenside.
Austrian Attack, Dragon Formation
The other critical line of the Austrian Attack is the Dragon Formation, which starts after 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 g6 4.f4 Bg7 5.Nf3 c5. Black strikes on the center before any of the players can castle. While 6.dxc5 is possible, most games continue with 6.Bb5+ Bd7 7.e5, which leads to a sharp game.
