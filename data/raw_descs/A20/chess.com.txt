
Black can respond to the English Opening (1.c4) by placing a pawn on the strong central square e5. This gives Black a good central presence and prepares to develop the Bf8.
Pros:

Black creates a good center
Takes control of d4
Rapid development

Cons:

Results in a Sicilian, down a tempo
Allows White to dominate the queenside
