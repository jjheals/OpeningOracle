In classical opening theory this imposing pawn centre was held to give White a large advantage, but the hypermodern school, which was coming to the fore in the 1920s, held that a large pawn centre could be a liability rather than an asset. White can develop their pieces in a number of ways in the Exchange Variation. For decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4\u2013f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchangevariation with White, often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1\u2013h8 diagonal. The Gr\u00fcnfeld Gambit is a variation of the Exchange Variation. White can accept the gambit by playing 6.cxd5 Nxd5 7.Nxd5 Qxd5 8.Bxc7, or decline it with 6.Qb3 or 6.Rc1, to which Black responds with 6...c5.

Black often chooses the order 2...e6 followed by 3...Bf5 to avoid the possibility of a symmetrical position. After 3...Nf6, the main line is 4.Nc3.

It enjoyed a rise in popularity in the early 1920s, but nowadays is rarely played at the top level. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game or cripple White's pawn structure. White does not try to defend his e5-pawn and keep his material advantage, but instead he concentrates on building an imposing pawn centre. Black can try to exploit weaknesses with the manoeuvres Bf4\u2013d2\u2013c3, Ng1\u2013e2\u2013g3\u2013h5 and h2\u2013h4. The Budapest Gambit is a variation of the Queen's Gambit. It is a move that involves pawn advances on the queenside, resulting in the creation of a weak pawn for Black, then winning this weak pawn. Black mates with either 31.Kf5 g6+ 32.KF6 Bd4 mate, or 31. Kf3 Rf2 mate. The move was referenced in season 28, episode 15, of The Simpsons, in an episode called \"The Cad and the Hat\" White must develop quietly with moves like Nc3/Nf3/E3/e3/Be2, and prepare several sacrificial ideas on e3 or f2.

The opening remains the most commonly used amongst the open games in master play. It has been adopted by almost all players during their careers, many have played it with both colours. The Riga Variation, 6...exd4, is considered inferior; the main line runs 7.Re1 d5 8.Nxd4 Bd6! 9.Nxc6 Bxh2+! 10.Kh1!

The Zaitsev Variation (also called the Flohr\u2013ZaitseV Variation) was advocated by Igor ZaitSEv, who was one of Karpov's trainers for many years. The Schliemann Defence is a sharp line in which Black plays for a kingside attack, frequently sacrificing one or two pawns.",
    "C97": "The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. The Morphy Defence is the most commonly played third move for Black. White's objective is to spoil Black's pawn structure. Black can respond in a wide variety of ways to White's third move. The theory of the Ruyopez is most extensively developed of all Open Games, with some lines having been analysed well beyond move thirty. The main line leads to unbalanced endgames which are difficult to play for both sides, though with a strong drawing tendency. The Schliemann Defence Deferred, 3...a6 4.Ba4 f5, is rarely seen, with practically its only top-level appearance being in the 1974 Candidates Final. The Chigorin Variation has declined in popularity because Black must spend some time bringing his offside knight on a5 back into the game. The Kholmov Variation, 9...Be6, was popular in the 1980s but is now played less often at the master level. The Berlin and Schliemann Defences are the most popular today. Henry Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9\u221213=3 (nine wins, thirteen losses, three draws) The world champion Magnus Carlsen played it in the 2014 Chess Olympiad against Ivan \u0160ari\u0107 and lost. The name derives from White's play if Black captures the knight: 4...Nxe5 5.d4.",
    "E61": "The Indian Game is a British breed of game chicken. It is a heavy, muscular bird with an unusually broad breast. It originated in the counties of Cornwall and Devon in south-west England. In the United States the name was changed in the early twentieth century to Cornish. A white variant, the White Cornish, was developed there at about the same time. The Indian Game was bred as a gamecock, but was not successful as a fighting bird. It was found to be a good meat breed, and was used for cross-breeding with established meat breeds.",

    "A05": "The King's Indian Attack is a chess opening system where White adopts the setup more commonly seen being played by Black in the King's India Defence. The King'sIndianAttack is a closed, strategic opening that presents its practitioner with common themes and tactics and a comfortable middlegame against various defences. Black is effectively a move down in a theoretically unimportant line of the King\u2019s Indian Defence. Black's most common plan involves the central pawn push e4\u2013e5, leading to a central bind, kingside space, and practical attacking chances against the black king. After 1.e4 e6, the game might typically proceed as follows: 4.Ngf3 Nf6 5.g3 Nc6 6.Bg2 Be7 7.0-0 0-0 8.Re1 (see diagram in previous section) White will now look to play e4\u2013e5, cramping Black, and then proceed with moves such as Nf1, Bf4, Qe2, h4, N1h2 (or Ne3), h5, g4 (or Ng4) The Kings Indian Attack setup is also sometimes employed against the Caro\u2013Kann Defence.

Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The McCutcheon Variation is named for John Lindsay McCutheon of Philadelphia (1857\u20131905), who brought the variation to public attention when he used it to defeat World Champion Steinitz in a simultaneous exhibition in Manhattan in 1885. The Burn Variation, the Morozevich Variation and the Advance Variation are the most difficult to play against due to the closed structure and unique strategies of the system. Black's natural French Defence move 6...c5 runs into 7.Bxe7 when Black must either move the king with 7...Kxe7 or allow 7...Qxe7 8.Nb5! The Advance Variation has the reputation of giving immediate equality to Black due to the symmetrical pawn structure. In the early 1990s, Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings includes an alphanumeric classification system for openings that is widely used in chess literature. Codes C00 to C19 are the French Defence, broken up in the following way (all apart from C00 start with the mov): C00-C19: C00, C01-C02, C04-C05, C06-C07, C08-C09, C10-C11, C12-C13, C14-C14, C15-C15, C16-C16, C17-C18, C19-C20, C21-C21, C22-C22, C23-C24, C24-C25, C26-C26, C27-C28, C28-C29, C29-C30, C30-C31, C31-C3, C4-C5, C6-C6, C7-C8, C8-C9, C9-C10, C11-C12, C3-C4, C5-C7, D5-D6, D7-D8, D8-D",

The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings classifies the opening under codes E60 through E99. 7.0-0 Na6 has seen some popularity recently. The purpose of this move is to transfer the knight to c5 after White's eventual d5. After 7...a5 White plays 8.Bg5 to pin the knight, making it harder for Black to achieve the ...f7\u2013f5 break. In the Exchange Variation (7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8), White exchanges queens and is content to play for a small, safe advantage in relatively quiet positions. The S\u00e4misch Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3. The Classical Defence is 5...0-0 6.Be3 e5. Black has a variety of pawn breaks, such as ...e5, ...c5 and ...b5 (prepared by ...c6 and/or ...a6) The game transposes into the Accelerated Dragon variation of the Sicilian Defence. The S\u00e4Misch Gambit is a pawn sacrifice. The Four Pawns Attack continues with 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f4 0-0 6.Nf3. With their fifth move, White erects a massive centre at the price of falling behind in development. From this 6...c5 is the main line. 6...Nbd7 and 6...Na6 (Judit Polg\u00e1r's move) are also seen. 9...Re8 can be justified with solid play. Black often repels the bishop with ...h6 giving them the option of a later g5, though in practice this is a weakening move. White has other setups, such as Nf3 and h3 and Nge2 (with or without Bd3), but these are currently not as popular at the grandmaster level. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nge2 followed by 6.Ng3 is called the Hungarian Attack.

    "A02": "Bird's Opening is a standard flank opening. It is named after 19th century English player Henry Bird. Black may challenge White's plan to control e5 immediately by playing From's Gambit (1...e5). The From Gambit is notoriously double-edged and should only be played after significant study. Black's most common response is 1...d5, when the game can take on the character of a Dutch Defence (1.d4 f5) with colours reversed. White will then often either fianchetto their king's bishop with Nf3, g3, Bg2, and 0\u20130 with a reversed Leningrad Dutch. Emanuel Lasker introduced 4...g5 in the game Bird\u2013Lasker, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1892. International Master (IM) Timothy Taylor, in his 2005 book on the Bird's, recommends 3.Nc3! Nxe5 4.d4 intending 5.e4, rather than 3.nf3?! g5! when Black stands well. After the normal 2...d6 3.exd6 Bxd6, White must play 4.Nf3, avoiding 4.c3?? Qh4+ 5.g3 Qxg3+ 6.hxg 3 Bxg2! or 4...Nf6, threatening 5...Ng4. The offbeat 1...b6!? is also known, and more soundly based than the same move after 1.e4 or 1.d4. The Swiss Gambit was named by Alexander Wagner (1868\u20131942), a Polish chess player and openings analyst who introduced it in the Swiss correspondence game Wagner\u2013Kostin, 1910\u201311. Another offbeat try is Martin Appleberry's 1...Nh6!?, also known as the Horsefly, which exploits the closed c1-h6 diagonal. 1.f4 ranks sixth in popularity in Chessgames.com's database. It is less than one-twentieth as popular as the mirror image English Opening (1.c4) The move slightly weakens White's king's position. Black's most successful response to Bird's Opening in the 1600-2200 rating range is e5, where Black's win percentage is 50-46%, but that evens to 48-48% when White plays 2.fxe5. The five more popular openings are still substantially more successful for White. Chess is a popular game of chess. Chess tournaments include the World Chess Championship and the FIDE Grand Prix. Chess is an important part of the arts and culture. chess is also used in music, film, and literature. Chess has its roots in the ancient city of Budapest in Hungary. Chess was first played in the 13th century by\u00a0Peter\u00a0Boltzmann in what is now known as the\u00a0Budapest Gambit. The opening of a chess game is often referred to as the first game.",
    "C30": "The King's Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves:1. e4 e52. If Black accepts the gambit, White may play d4 and Bxf4. It is infrequently seen at master level today, as Black has several methods to obtain equality, but is still popular at amateur level. It was one of the most popular openings until the late 19th century, when improvements in defensive technique led to its decline in popularity. The main reason is that it is hard to gain an advantage with White's pawn. After 2...exf4, the two main continuations for White are 3.Nf3 (King's Knight's Gambit) and 3.Bc4 (Bishop'sGambit) Black's two main approaches are to attempt to hold on to the pawn with ...g5, or to return the pawn in order to facilitate development. The Kieseritzky Gambit, 4.h4 g4 5.Ne5, is considered by modern writers such as John Shaw and Joseph Gallagher to be the main line after 3...g5. The Quaade Gambit (3.Nf3 g5 4.Nc3) is named after a Danish amateur who discussed it in correspondence with the Deutsche Schachzeitung in the 1880s. The move has received renewed attention following its recommendation by John Shaw in his 2013 book on the King's Gambit. A well-known trap here is 4...g4 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.g3 fxg3 7.Qxg4 g2+. The Fischer Defense (3.Nf3 d6) was advocated by Bobby Fischer after he was defeated by Boris Spassky in a Kieseritzky Gambit at the 1960 Mar del Plata tournament. The MacLeod Defense, 3...Nc6, is named after Nicholas MacLeod. The Bishop's Gambit allows 3...Bc4+ 4...Qh4+ but White loses the right to castle. Black's most popular option, it attracted some attention in 2020 when Ding Liren used it to beat Magnus Carlsen in an online tournament. Black's other main option is 3...d5, returning the pawn immediately. John Shaw wrote that 3...Nc6 is a \"refutation\" of the Bishop's Gambit, as he says that Black is better in all variations. The Falkbeer Countergambit is named after the 19th-century Austrian master Ernst Falkbeer. It runs 1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5 3.exd5 e4, in which Black sacrifices a pawn in return for quick and easy development. 2...Nc6, advocated by Tony Miles; 2...d6, which is the way the King\u2019s Gambit was declined the first known time it was played.

    "A34": "The English Opening is a chess opening that begins with the move:1.c4ECOA10\u2013A39. It is one of the four most successful of White's twenty possible first moves. The English derives its name from the leading 19th century English master Howard Staunton, who played it during his 1843 match with Saint-Amant. Bobby Fischer created a stir when he switched to it from his customary 1.e4 late in his career. Mikhail Botvinnik, Tigran Petrosian, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen and Ding Liren have employed it during their world championship matches. There are several types of positions that can arise from the Symmetrical Defence. The Hedgehog system involves a solid but flexible defence in which Black develops by b6, e6, Bb7, and Be7, before controlling the fifth rank with moves such as a6 and d6. The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20\u201329 in ECO) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. Black can delay playing ...e5, for example 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 whereupon even though ...e4 has been delayed, once it is played the defence is classified as a Reversing Sicilian. 1...g5 is an eccentric response known as Myers' Defense after Hugh Myers's advocacy of it in print and actual play. After 2.d4, Black will put pressure on the d4-square with moves such as ...Bg7, ...c5, and ...Qb6. If White plays an early d4, the game will usually transpose into either the Queen's Gambit or an Indian Defence. The many different transpositional possibilities available to White make the English a slippery opening for Black to defend against. The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows as he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. It is also used in Pawn Sacrifice by Bobby Fischer in the climactic game six of the 1972 World Chess Championship versus Boris Spassky. The opening was written by Edward Winter in the late 19th century and is now considered a classic. There are several variations of the opening, including the Fianchetto Line and the Symmetry Line.

In recent years, it has become nearly as popular as 3. nd2; GM Alexander Grischuk has championed it successfu. Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3 in the early 1990s, before switching back to the traditional 3.nc2. The Advance has been the subject of a number of books, including one written by the legendary Russian chess master Anatoly Kuznetsov, which was published in 2000.",
    "C39": "The King's Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves:1. e4 e52. If Black accepts the gambit, White may play d4 and Bxf4, regaining the Gambit pawn. It is infrequently seen at master level today, as Black has several methods to obtain equality, but is still popular at amateur level. It was one of the most popular openings until the late 19th century, when improvements in defensive technique led to its decline in popularity. The Kieseritzky Gambit, 4.h4 g4 5.Ne5, is considered by modern writers to be the main line after 3...g5. Boris Spassky used it to beat Bobby Fischer in a famous game at Mar del Plata in 1960. The Long Whip Variation, 5...h5?! 6.Bc4 Rh7 (or 6...Nh6) is considered old-fashioned and risky, as Black loses a lot of time attempting to hold on to the pawn. The Quaade Gambit (3.Nf3 g5 4.Nc3) is named after a Danish amateur who discussed it in correspondence with the Deutsche Schachzeitung in the 1880s. A well-known trap here is 4...g4 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.g3 fxg3 7.Qxg4 g2+? (7.Nxg 4 d5 is about equal) White has strong central control with pawns on d4 and e4. Black is relying on the white king's discomfort to compensate. The Fischer Defense (3.Nf3 d6), although previously known, was advocated by Bobby Fischer after he was defeated by Boris Spassky in a Kieseritzky Gambit at the 1960 Mar del Plata tournament. Fischer's analysis of 3...d6, which he called \"a high-class waiting move\", was published in the American Chess Quarterly in 1960. The MacLeod Defense, 3...Nc6, is named after Nicholas MacLeod. Like Fischer's Defense, it is a waiting move. The Bishop's Gambit, 3.Bc4, is the most important. Black's other main option is 3...d5, returning the pawn immediately. John Shaw wrote that 3...Nc6 is a \"refutation\" of the Bishop's Gambit, as he says that Black is better in all variations. The Falkbeer Countergambit is named after the 19th-century Austrian master Ernst Falkbeer. It runs 1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5 3.exd5 e4, in which Black sacrifices a pawn in return for quick development. The King's Gambit is one of the oldest countergambits in chess. It is considered dubious because 3.exf5 with the threat of Qh5+ gives White a good game. The variation is sometimes named the Pantelidakis Countergambit because GM Larry Evans answered a question about it in Chess Life and Review. White may also offer the gambit in the Bishop's Opening, e.g. 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.f4, though this is uncommon.",
    "C01": "The French Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1.e4 e6, 2.d4 d5, 3.Nc3 or 3.e5. Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience, although some lines such as the Winawer Variation can lead to sharp complications. Black's natural French Defence move 6...c5 runs into 7.Bxe7 when Black must either move the king with 7...Kxe7 or allow 7...Qxe7 8.Nb5! The Steinitz Variation is named after Wilhelm Steinitz. The McCutcheon Variation was named for John Lindsay McCutchene. The Advance Variation was developed by GM Evgeny Sveshnikov in the 1970s. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings includes an alphanumeric classification system for openings that is widely use. The system is based on a. structure of letters, numbers, and letters of the alphabet. It is also based on an alphabetical list of letters and numbers. The opening structure is called the \"Advance Variation\" or the \"A-V\" structure. It has been used in chess for more than 100 years and is still widely used in some parts of the world, such as Russia and the U.S. It was revived in the 1980s by GM and prominent opening theoretician Evgeni SvesHnikov.",
    "A33": "The English Opening is a chess opening that begins with the move:1.c4ECOA10\u2013A39. It is one of the four most successful of White's twenty possible first moves. The English derives its name from the leading 19th century English master Howard Staunton, who played it during his 1843 match with Saint-Amant. Bobby Fischer created a stir when he switched to it from his customary 1.e4 late in his career. Mikhail Botvinnik, Tigran Petrosian, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen and Ding Liren have employed it during their world championship matches. There are several types of positions that can arise from the Symmetrical Defence. The Hedgehog system involves a solid but flexible defence in which Black develops by b6, e6, Bb7, and Be7. The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20\u201329 in ECO) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. Black can delay playing ...e5, for example 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5. All irregular responses such as 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category. 1...g5 is an eccentric response known as Myers' Defense. It is intended as an improved Grob's Attack. Black will put pressure on the d4-square with moves such as ...Bg7, ...c5, and ...Qb6. If White plays an early d4, the game will usually transpose into either the Queen's Gambit or an Indian Defence. The many transpositional possibilities available to White make the English a slippery opening for Black to defend against. The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows as he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. The opening is also used in Pawn Sacrifice by Bobby Fischer in the climactic game six of the 1972 World Chess Championship versus Boris Spassky. The English Opening was written by Edward Winter in the late 19th century. It is one of the most widely used chess openings in the world. There are a number of variations of the English Opening, including the Fianchetto Line.

    "E68": "The King's Indian Defence (or KID) is a common chess opening. It is defined by the following moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 g6. Black intends to follow up with 3...Bg7 and 4...d6 (the Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence arises when Black plays 3...d5 instead and is considered a separate opening) It is a hypermodern opening, where Black deliberately allows White control of the centre with pawns, with the view to subsequently challenge it. The opening is a favourite of former world champions Garry Kasparov and Bobby Fischer. 7.0-0 Na6 has seen some popularity recently. After 7...a5 White plays 8.Bg5 to pin the knight, making it harder for Black to achieve the ...f7\u2013f5 break. In the Exchange Variation (7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8), White exchanges queens and is content to play for a small, safe advantage in relatively quiet positions. Black will often have at least an equal position if they are able to play ...Nd4. The S\u00e4misch Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3. The game transposes into the Accelerated Dragon variation of the Sicilian Defence. Black has a variety of pawn breaks, such as ...e5, ...c5 and ...b5 (prepared by ...c6 and/or ...a6) This can transpose to the Modern Benoni after 5...0-0 6.Bg5 c5 7.d5 e6. Black's most popular response is 7.Be3, similar to the Gligoric System. The Four Pawns Attack continues with 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f4 0-0 6.Nf3. With their fifth move, White erects a massive centre at the price of falling behind in development. From this 6...c5 is the main line. Black often repels the bishop with ...h6 giving them the option of a later g5. The most common responses are:6...Nbd7 with 8...exd4. Black intends to claim the centre with ...e7\u2013e5. One of the earliest examples: John Cochrane vs. Bonnerjee Mohishunder, Calcutta, India, 1851 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nge2 followed by 6.Ng3 is called the Hungarian Attack.

    "C96": "The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. Due to the difficulty for Black in achieving equality, a common nickname for the opening is \"The Spanish Torture\" The most commonly played third move for Black is the Morphy Defence, 3...a6, a move that forces White to retreat or exchange for Black's knight. The opening remains the most commonly used amongst the open games in master play; it has been adopted by almost all players. The most common line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. The Exchange Variation, 4.Bxc6, (ECO C68\u2013C69) White damages Black's pawn structure. The main line begins with 9.exd5 Nxd5 (9...e4?!, the Herman Steiner variation, is considered weaker) 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 c6 (Marshall's original moves, 11...Nf6, and 11...Bb7 are considered inferior, but have also yielded good results) The Pilnik Variation, named for Hermann Pilnik, is also known as the Teichmann Variation. White plays 9.d3 intending to later advance to d4 under favourable circumstances. The Breyer Variation was recommended by Gyula Breyer as early as 1911, but there are no known game records in which Breyer employed this line. The Schliemann Defence (ECO C63), 3...f5 is a sharp line in which Black plays for a kingside attack, frequently sacrificing one or two pawns. The Steinitz Defence (3...d6) is solid but passive and cramped.",
    "E34": "The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 e63. Nc3 Bb4. It was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. It is a highly respected defence to 1.d4 and has been played by every world champion since Capablanca. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response to 4...e5. The Karpov Variation is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. The Main Variation was enormously popular in the 1950s, but the name has become increasingly inappropriate ever since. The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 and 4...Nc6. 1d1 1b2 1b1 2 1b3 1b4 1b5 1b6 1b7 1b8 1b9 1b10 1b11 1b12 1b13 1b14 1b15 1b16 1b17 1b18 1b19 1b20 1b21 1b22 1b23 1b24 1b25 1b26 1b27 1b28 1b29 1b30 1b31 1b32 1b33 1b34 1b36 1b38 1b39 1b40 1b41 1b42 1b44 1b45 1b51 1b52 1b53 1b54 1b55 1b56 1b57 1b58 1b59 1b60 1b61 1b62 1b64 1b65 1b66 1b72 1b73 1b74 1b75 1b76 1b77 1b78 1b79 1b80 1b81 1b82 1b83 1b84 1b85 1b92 1b94 1b90 1b96 1b98 1b99 1b100 1b102 1b103 1b104 1b105 1b106 1b107 1b108 1b110 1b111 1b112 1b113 1b114 1b115 1b120 1b122 1b133 1b138 1b140 1b142",

The Rubinstein System (named after Akiba Rubinstein) is Black's most common method of combating the opening. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response. The Karpov Variation, (7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 cxd4 9.exd4 b6) is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. Black may play 9...b6, with the intention of playing ...cxd4 at some point to isolate the d-pawn and blockade it, or exchange on c3 as well to play against the isolated c3\u2013d4 pawn couple.

Black will play a quick ...e5 to pressurize d4. If White has a bishop on d3, then Black also threatens ...e4 forking it and the knight on f3. White will try to advance their centre pawns to free their bishops: c4, d5, and f3 followed by e4 are all possible. 4...c5 is one of the most popular moves in the game. There are two major variations particular to 4... c5: 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3 (6.Ne2 will likely transpose to the Modern Variation) 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 is the H\u00fcbner Variation, popularized by GM Robert H\u00fc bner in the late 1960s and '70s and utilised by Bobby Fischer in his world championship match with Boris Spassky.

Ne2 Ne4, as it was pioneered by GM Isaac Kashdan and then developed by GM Bisguier, Anthony Santasiere and currently GM Nick de Firmian. White has two ways to attack Black's setup: 8.cxd5 exd5 followed by 10.f4 and transferring the queen or f1-rook to h3 via f3. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are common Black replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5 or 5... 0-0 6.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 b6 7.Bg5) or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 6.Nf3 Na6). In the former case, the bishop will eventually retreat to e7 and Black will set up a Hedgehog formation. 4...Nc6 is the Z\u00fcrich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. White usually plays on the queenside in this variation. Garry Kasparov used it to great effect against Anatoly Karpov in their 1985 World Championship match. Today as White, this is a favourite weapon of GM Alexei Barsov and former Women's Champion Nona Gaprindashvili. White develops the knight to a natural square and waits to see Black's reply.

It was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. It is a highly respected defence to 1.d4 and has been played by every world champion since Capablanca. It can also transpose into lines of the Queen's Gambit or Queen's Indian Defence. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response to the Rubinstein System. The Karpov Variation is one of Black's most reliable defences to the system. The Larsen Variation (named after GM Bent Larsen) can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 or 7...Nc6 9.a3 Ba5. The Main Variation was enormously popular in the 1950s, but the name has become increasingly inappropriate ever since. There are several move orders to reach the Main Variation besides the one given above; 4.e3 0-0 5.Bd3 d5 6.a3 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 dxc4 8.Bxc4 c5 9.Nf3 Nc6 10.0-0 is one worth noting, because White may try 9.Ne2 instead. In the Rubinstein, White has often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight. 4...c5 is one of the most popular moves in the game. There are two major variations particular to 4... c5: 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3 (6.Ne2 will likely transpose to the Modern Variation) 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 is the H\u00fcbner Variation, popularized by GM Robert H\u00fcBner in the late 1960s and '70s and utilised by Bobby Fischer in his world championship match with Boris Spassky. The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5. The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. Black often sets up a Hedgehog formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6), while White will try to pursue a strategy of gaining queenside space with b4 and c5. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are all common replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 6.Nf3 Na6) White almost always plays 5.dxc5. The Pirc Variation was not popular during the mid-20th century, because the lines where Black eventually recaptures with theKnight was reckoned to give Black easy equality. 4...Nc6 is the Z\u00fcrich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. Garry Kasparov used it to great effect against Anatoly Karpov in their 1985 World Championship match.

The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings classifies it under the codes E60 through E99. 7.0-0 Na6 has seen some popularity recently. The purpose of this move is to transfer the knight to c5 after White's eventual d5. After 7...a5 White plays 8.Bg5 to pin the knight, making it harder for Black to achieve the ...f7\u2013f5 break. In the Exchange Variation (7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8), White exchanges queens and is content to play for a small, safe advantage in relatively quiet positions. The S\u00e4misch Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3. Black has a variety of pawn breaks, such as ...e5, ...c5 and ...b5 (prepared by ...c6 and/or ...a6). This can transpose to the Modern Benoni after 5...0-0 6.Bg5 c5 7.d5 e6. Black can strike for the centre as previously mentioned or delay with 6...Nc6, 7...a6 and 8...Rb8.

The Main Variation was enormously popular in the 1950s but the name has become increasingly inappropriate ever since. After 4.e3 0-0 White has a huge selection of moves to choose from, and Black must be familiar with all of them. White will try to advance their centre pawns to free their bishops: c4, d5, and f3 followed by e4 are all possible. If Black can prevent White from achieving this, then they will enjoy the better game. In the Rubinstein, White has often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight, thus avoiding the doubled pawns. 4.e3 c5 is one of the most popular moves in the game.

    "C38": "The King's Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves:1. e4 e52. If Black accepts the gambit, White may play d4 and Bxf4, regaining the Gambit pawn with central domination. It is infrequently seen at master level today, as Black has several methods to obtain equality, but is still popular at amateur level. It was one of the most popular openings until the late 19th century, when improvements in defensive technique led to its decline in popularity. The main reason is that it is hard to gain an advantage with strong opponents. The Kieseritzky Gambit, 4.h4 g4 5.Ne5, is considered by modern writers such as John Shaw and Joseph Gallagher to be the main line after 3...g5. Boris Spassky used it to beat Bobby Fischer in a famous game at Mar del Plata in 1960. The Long Whip Variation, 5...h5?! 6.Bc4 Rh7 (or 6...Nh6) is considered old-fashioned and risky, as Black loses a lot of time attempting to hold on to the pawn. The Quaade Gambit (3.Nf3 g5 4.Nc3) is named after a Danish amateur who discussed it in correspondence with the Deutsche Schachzeitung in the 1880s. The move has received renewed attention following its recommendation by John Shaw in his 2013 book on the King's Gambit. A well-known trap here is 4...g4 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.g3 fxg3 7.Qxg4 g2+? The Fischer Defense (3.Nf3 d6), although previously known, was advocated by Bobby Fischer after he was defeated by Boris Spassky in a Kieseritzky Gambit at the 1960 Mar del Plata tournament. The MacLeod Defense, 3...Nc6, is named after Nicholas MacLeod. The Bishop's Gambit allows 3...Bc4+ 4...Qh4+ but loses the right to lose the castle. Black's most popular option, it attracted some attention in 2020 when Ding Liren used it to beat Magnus Carlsen. Black's other main option is 3...d5, returning the pawn immediately. John Shaw wrote that 3...Nc6 is a \"refutation\" of the Bishop's Gambit, as he says that Black is better in all variations. The Falkbeer Countergambit is named after the 19th-century Austrian master Ernst Falkbeer. It runs 1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5 3.exd5 e4, in which Black sacrifices a pawn in return for quick and easy development. The King's Gambit is one of the oldest countergambits in Chess. It is considered dubious because 3.exf5 with the threat of Qh5+ gives White a good game. The variation is sometimes named the Pantelidakis Countergambit because GM Larry Evans answered a question about it in Chess Life and Review. White may also offer the gambit in the Bishop's Opening, e.g. 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.f4, though this is uncommon.",
    "C31": "The King's Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves:1.e4 e5 2.f4ECOC30\u2013C39 Origin no later than 16th century. It was one of the most popular openings until the late 19th century, when improvements in defensive technique led to its decline in popularity. It is infrequently seen at master level today, as Black has several methods to obtain equality, but is still popular at amateur level. In 2012, an April Fools' Day prank by Chessinventor Ryik Rajlich claimed to have proven to a 99.9999% certainty that a draw is at best possible. The two main continuations for White are 3.Nf3 (King's Knight's Gambit) and 3.Bc4 (Bishop's Gam bit) Black usually accepts the gambit pawn, but two methods of declining it are also popular. The Kieseritzky Gambit, 4.h4 g4 5.Ne5, is considered by modern writers such as John Shaw to be the main line after 3...g5. Boris Spassky used it to beat Bobby Fischer in a famous game at Mar del Plata in 1960. The Quaade Gambit (3.Nf3 g5 4.Nc3) is named after a Danish amateur who discussed it in correspondence with the Deutsche Schachzeitung in the 1880s. The move has received renewed attention following its recommendation by John Shaw in his 2013 book on the King's Gambit. White has strong central control with pawns on d4 and e4, while Black is relying on the white king's discomfort to compensate. Black's best defense is considered 9...Nh6 10.d4 d6 11.Bxh6 dxe5 12.Qxe5+ Be6 13.Qxh8 Nd7 14.Bxf8 0-0-0. The Fischer Defense (3.Nf3 d6), although previously known, was advocated by Bobby Fischer after he was defeated by Boris Spassky in a Kieseritzky Gambit at the 1960 Mar del Plata tournament. Fischer then decided to refute the King's Gambit, and the next year the American Chess Quarterly published Fischer's analysis of 3...d6. The main alternative to 4.d4 is 4.Bc4. The MacLeod Defense, 3...Nc6, is named after Nicholas MacLeod. Black's other main option is 3...d5, returning the pawn immediately. John Shaw wrote that 3...Nc6 is a \"refutation\" of the Bishop's Gambit, as he says that Black is better in all variations. The Falkbeer Countergambit is named after the 19th-century Austrian master Ernst Falkbeer. It runs 1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5 3.exd5 e4, in which Black sacrifices a pawn in return for quick and easy development. 2...Nc6 3.Nf3 f5, advocated by Tony Miles; 2...d6, which is the way the King\u2019s Gambit was declined the first known time it was played. The greedy 2...Qf6 (known as the Nordwalde Variation), intending 3...Qxf4, is considered dubious. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings has ten codes for the King's Gambit, C30 through C39. White may also offer the gambit in the Bishop's Opening, e.g. 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc3 3.f4, though this is uncommon.",
    "A03": "Bird's Opening is a standard flank opening. It offers good attacking chances at the expense of slightly weakening their own kingside. Black may challenge White's plan to control e5 immediately by playing From's Gambit (1...e5); however, the From Gambit is notoriously double-edged and should only be played after significant study. The opening was mentioned by Luis Ram\u00edrez de Lucena in his book Repetici\u00f3n de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez con Cien Juegos de Partido, published c. 1497. Emanuel Lasker introduced 4...g5 in the game Bird\u2013Lasker, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1892. International Master (IM) Timothy Taylor, in his 2005 book on the Bird's. Bird's, recommends 3.Nc3! Nxe5 4.d4 intending 5.e4, rather than 3.nf3?! g5! when Black stands well. After the normal 2...d6 3.exd6 Bxd6, White must play 4.Nf3, avoiding 4.C3?? Qh4+ 5.g3 Qxg3+ 6.hxg 3 Bxg2! or 4...Nf6, threatening 5...Ng4. Offbeat moves include 1...b6!? and 1...g5?! The Swiss Gambit was named by Alexander Wagner (1868\u20131942), a Polish chess player and openings analyst who introduced it in the Swiss correspondence game Wagner\u2013Kostin, 1910\u201311. White's best line is quiet play with 2.b3 b6 3.Bb2 Bb7 4.e3, when 4...Nf6 5.Bxf6! exf6 6.Nf3 left White with the better pawn structure in Larsen\u2013Colon Romero, 1969. 1.f4 ranks sixth in popularity in Chessgames.com's database. It is less than one-twentieth as popular as the mirror image English Opening (1.c4).[15] The move slightly weakens White's king's position. White scores much better with the more popular 1.e4 (54.25%), 1.d4 (55.95%) and 1.Nf3 ( 55.8%). Black's most successful response to Bird's Opening in that rating range is e5, where Black's win percentage is 50-46%. Chess is a popular game of chess. Chess tournaments include the World Chess Championship and the FIDE Grand Prix. Chess can be played in many different ways, including rook pawns and bishop pawns. Chess is popular in film, literature, and the arts. There are many chess books and chess periodicals. There is also a chess website, Chess World.com, and a chess tournament website, the Chess Olympiad, which holds the world championship. The Chess World Cup is the most prestigious chess tournament in the world.",

The opening is a favourite of former world champions Garry Kasparov, Bobby Fischer and Mikhail Tal. 7.0-0 Na6 has seen some popularity recently. The purpose of this move is to transfer the knight to c5 after White's eventual d5. After 7...a5 White plays 8.Bg5 to pin the knight, making it harder for Black to achieve the ...f7\u2013f5 break. In the Exchange Variation (7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8), White exchanges queens and is content to play for a small, safe advantage in relatively quiet positions. The S\u00e4misch Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3.

    "E58": "The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 e63. Nc3 Bb4. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings, it is classified as E20\u2013E59. It was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. It is a highly respected defence to 1.d4 and has been played by every world champion since Capablanca. It can also transpose into lines of the Queen's Gambit or Queen's Indian Defence. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response. The Karpov Variation is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. The Larsen Variation can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Bxc3 dxc4 10.bxc3 Qc7 (Main Variation) or 7...Nc6 8.A3 Ba5 9.Bg5 Bb7 10.Rc1 and 11.Qe2 are good moves for White. After 4.e3 0-0, White has a huge selection of moves to choose from, and Black must be familiar with all of them. White will try to advance their centre pawns to free their bishops: c4, d5, and f3 followed by e4 are all possible. If Black can prevent White from achieving this, then they will enjoy the better game. There are several move orders to reach the Main Variation besides the one given above. In the Rubinstein, White often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight. 4.e3 is one of the most popular moves in the game. There are two major variations particular to 4...c5: 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3 (6.Ne2 will likely transpose to the Modern Variation) 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 is the H\u00fcbner Variation, popularized by GM Robert H\u00fcBner in the late 1960s and '70s and utilised by Bobby Fischer in his world championship match with Boris Spassky. The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5. The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. The Capablanca Position was popular in the early days of the Nimzo-Indian game, though it was superseded by the Rubinstein Variation. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are common replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (6.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 b6 7.Bg5) White almost always plays 5.dxc5. The Pirc Variation has become unplayable at the highest level. 4...Nc6 is the Z\u00fcrich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. White usually plays on the queenside in this variation, while Black will try to play on the kingside with ...f5. Garry Kasparov used it to great effect against Anatoly Karpov in their 1985 World Championship match. It is a favourite weapon of GM Alexei Barsov and former Women's Champion Nona Gaprindashvili.

After 1...a5 White will most likely play 2.b5 and take advantage of Black's queenside weakness. Black will generally place pressure on the c5-square and will develop an attack against White's weak queenside structure at the cost of an inferior central position.

It was one of the most popular openings until the late 19th century, when improvements in defensive technique led to its decline in popularity.

Boris Spassky used it to beat Bobby Fischer in a famous game at Mar del Plata in 1960. The Long Whip Variation, 5...h5?! 6.Bc4 Rh7 (or 6...Nh6) is considered old-fashioned and risky, as Black loses a lot of time attempting to hold on to the pawn. The Quaade Gambit (3.Nf3 g5 4.Nc3) is named after a Danish amateur who discussed it in correspondence with the Deutsche Schachzeitung in the 1880s. A well-known trap here is 4...g4 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.g3 fxg3 7.Qxg4 g2+?

It has the reputation of giving immediate equality to Black due to the symmetrical pawn structure. The Advance is considered one of the most difficult openings in the world to play.

    "A19": "The English Opening is a chess opening that begins with the move:1.c4ECOA10\u2013A39. It is one of the four most successful of White's twenty possible first moves. The English derives its name from the leading 19th century English master Howard Staunton, who played it during his 1843 match with Saint-Amant. Bobby Fischer created a stir when he switched to it from his customary 1.e4 late in his career. Mikhail Botvinnik, Tigran Petrosian, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen and Ding Liren have employed it during their world championship matches. The Hedgehog system involves a solid but flexible defence in which Black develops by b6, e6, Bb7, and Be7, before controlling the fifth rank with moves such as a6 and d6. The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20\u201329 in ECO) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. Black can delay playing ...e5, for example 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5. All irregular responses such as 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category. 1...g5 is an eccentric response known as Myers' Defense after Hugh Myers's advocacy of it in print and actual play. After 2.d4, Black will put pressure on the d4-square with moves such as ...Bg7, ...c5, and ...Qb6. Black obtains no immediate compensation for the sacrificed pawn. If White plays an early d4, the game will usually transpose into either the Queen's Gambit or an Indian Defence. The many different transpositional possibilities available to White make the English a slippery opening for Black to defend against. The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows as he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. The opening is also used in Pawn Sacrifice by Bobby Fischer in the climactic game six of the 1972 World Chess Championship versus Boris Spassky. The English Opening was first written by Edward Winter in the early 19th century. There are many variations of the opening, including the Fianchetto Line and the Symmetry Line.

    "C14": "The French Defence is a symmetrical system of chess. Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. White can exploit the absence of Black's dark-square bishop by playing 7. qg4, giving Black two choices: he may sacrifice his kingside pawns with 7...Q c7 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4 or he can play 7...0-0 8.Bd3 Nbc6, which avoids giving up material, but leaves the king on the flank. Black can also try 5...Be7 6.Bxf6 gxf6, as played by Alexander Morozevich and Gregory Kaidanov. The Advance is a symmetrical pawn structure. It has the reputation of giving immediate equality to Black. Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings includes an alphanumeric classification system for openings that is widely use. The Advance declined in popularity, however, throughout most of the 20th century until it was revived in the 1980s by GM and prominent opening theoretician Evgeny Sveshnikov.

Bobby Fischer created a stir when he switched to it from his customary 1.e4 late in his career. Mikhail Botvinnik, Tigran Petrosian, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen, and Ding Liren have employed it during their world championship matches. The Hedgehog system involves a solid but flexible defence in which Black develops by b6, e6, Bb7, and Be7, before controlling the fifth rank with moves such as a6 and d6. The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20\u201329 in ECO) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. Black can delay playing ...e5, for example 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 whereupon even though ... e5 has been delayed, once it is played the defence is classified as a Reversing Sicilian. The third broad category consists of the non-....e5 and non-...c5 responses. 1...g5 is an eccentric response known as Myers' Defense after Hugh Myers's advocacy of it in print and actual play. After 2.d4, Black will put pressure on the d4-square with moves such as ...Bg7, ...c5, and ...Qb6. If White plays an early d4, the game will usually transpose into either the Queen's Gambit or an Indian Defence. Black also cannot force a Gr\u00fcnfeld with 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 g6 3.e4. The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows as he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. The opening is also used in Pawn Sacrifice by Bobby Fischer in the climactic game six of the 1972 World Chess Championship versus Boris Spassky. There are several variations of the English Opening, including the \"Fianchetto Line\" and the \"Mecking Variation\" The opening was written by Edward Winter in the late 19th century.

    "E42": "The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 e63. Nc3 Bb4. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings, it is classified as E20\u2013E59. This hypermodern opening was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch in the early 20th century. It is a highly respected defence to 1.d4 and has been played by every world champion since Capablanca. It can also transpose into lines of the Queen's Gambit. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response. The Karpov Variation is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. The Larsen Variation can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Bxc3 dxc4 10.bxc3 Qc7 (Main Variation) or 7...Nc6 8.A3 Ba5 9.Bg5 Bb7 10.Rc1 and 11.Qe2 are good moves for White. The Rubinstein Variation (4.e3 0-0, 5.Bd3 d5 6.Ne2) is the most common way to reach the Main Variation of the game. The Averbakh Variation was popularized by GMs Viacheslav Ragozin and Yuri A verbakh. The Khasin Variation, named after International Master Abram Khasin, is the usual continuation. In the Rubinstein, White often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight, thus avoiding the doubled pawns. 4...c5 is the most popular move in the game. There are two major variations particular to 4\u2026c5: 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3 (6.Ne2 will likely transpose to the Modern Variation) 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 is the H\u00fcbner Variation, popularized by GM Robert H\u00fcBner in the late 1960s and '70s and utilised by Bobby Fischer in his world championship match with Boris Spassky. The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5. The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. The Capablanca Position was popular in the early days of the Nimzo-Indian game, though it was superseded by the Rubinstein Variation. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are common replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 6.Nf3 Na6) The Pirc Variation was one of the reasons why 4. Qc2 was not popular during the mid-20th century. Edmar Medmar Mednis's remark that the entire Medmar Variation had become unplayable at the highest level cites this problem with 4...C5. 4...Nc6 is the Z\u00fcrich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. White usually plays on the queenside in this variation, while Black will try to play on the kingside with ...f5. Garry Kasparov used it to great effect against Anatoly Karpov in their 1985 World Championship match. It is a favourite weapon of GM Alexei Barsov and former Women's Champion Nona Gaprindashvili.

Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (6.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 b6 7.Bg5) White almost always plays 5.dxc5.

    "C25": "The Vienna Game is an opening in chess that begins with the moves:1.e4 e5 2.Nc3ECOC25\u2013C29. The original idea behind the Vienna Game was to play a delayed King's Gambit with f4 (the Vienna Gambit) In modern play White often plays more quietly (for example, by fianchettoing his king's bishop with g3 and Bg2). Black most often continues with 2...Nf6. The opening can also lead to the Frankenstein\u2013Dracula Variation. The Mieses Variation is a quiet continuation in which White fianchettoes his king's bishop, a line played by Vasily Smyslov on a few occasions, most notably in a win over Lev Polugaevsky in the 1961 USSR Championship. The late American master Ariel Mengarini advocated the whimsical 3.a3. The best line may be 3...Bc5 (better than 5...e4 6...d4, when the normal 6...Reb4 is impossible) The Hamppe\u2013Muzio Gambit is characterised by the continuation 3...exf4 4.Nf3 g5 5.Bc4 g4 6.0-0 gxf3 7.Qxf3 (see diagram) The Steinitz Gambit was a favorite of Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Champion.

    "E74": "The King's Indian Defence (or KID) is a common chess opening. It is defined by the following moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 g6. Black intends to follow up with 3...Bg7 and 4...d6 (the Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence arises when Black plays 3...d5 instead and is considered a separate opening) White's major third move options are 3.Nc3, 3.nf3 or 3.g3. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings classifies the opening under the codes E60 through E99. 7.0-0 Na6 has seen some popularity recently. The purpose of this move is to transfer the knight to c5 after White's eventual d5. After 7...a5 White plays 8.Bg5 to pin the knight, making it harder for Black to achieve the ...f7\u2013f5 break. In the Exchange Variation (7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8), White exchanges queens and plays for a small, safe advantage in relatively quiet positions. The S\u00e4misch Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3. The game transposes into the Accelerated Dragon variation of the Sicilian Defence. Black has a variety of pawn breaks, such as ...e5, ...c5 and ...b5 (prepared by ...c6 and/or ...a6). This can transpose to the Modern Benoni after 5...0-0 6.Bg5 c5 7.d5 e6. White's most popular response is 7.Be3, similar to the Gligoric System. The Averbakh Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Be2 0-0 6.Bg5. The Fianchetto Variation 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3. nf3 Bf3 4.g3 0-1 5.g2 d6 6.0-0 is named for White's development of light-squared bishop to g2.

    "C22": "The Center Game is a chess opening that begins with the moves:1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4. The game usually continues 3.Qxd4 Nc6, developing with a gain of tempo for Black due to the attack on the white queen. The best move for the queen seems to be 4.Qe3, known as Paulsen's Attack. White intends to castle queenside in this line. Black can safely transpose to the Scotch Game, Petrov's Defense or the Philidor Defense.",
    "A10": "The English Opening is a chess opening that begins with the move:1.c4ECOA10\u2013A39. It is one of the four most successful of White's twenty possible first moves. The English derives its name from the leading 19th century English master Howard Staunton, who played it during his 1843 match with Saint-Amant. Bobby Fischer created a stir when he switched to it from his customary 1.e4 late in his career. Mikhail Botvinnik, Tigran Petrosian, Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen, and Ding Liren have employed it during world championship matches. The Hedgehog system involves a solid but flexible defence in which Black develops by b6, e6, Bb7, and Be7, before controlling the fifth rank with moves such as a6 and d6. The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20\u201329 in ECO) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. Black can delay playing ...e5, for example 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5 whereupon even though ...e4 has been delayed, once it is played the defence is classified as a Reversing Sicilian. 1...g5 is an eccentric response known as Myers' Defense after Hugh Myers's advocacy of it in print and actual play. It is intended as an improved Grob's Attack. After 2.d4, Black will put pressure on the d4-square with moves such as ...Bg7, ...c5, and ...Qb6. Black obtains no immediate compensation for the sacrificed pawn. If White plays an early d4, the game will usually transpose into either the Queen's Gambit or an Indian Defence. The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows as he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. The opening is also used in Pawn Sacrifice by Bobby Fischer in the climactic game six of the 1972 World Chess Championship versus Boris Spassky. There are a number of variations on the opening, including the Fianchetto Line and the Symmetry Line. The English Opening was first written by Edward Winter in the 19th century.

    "C82": "The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening characterised by the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5. It is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura. White's objective in playing the Ruyopez is to spoil Black's pawn structure. The most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. Black almost always responds 4...dxc6. The Exchange Variation, 4.Bxc6, (ECO C68\u2013C69) White damages Black\u2019s pawn structure, gaining a ready-made long-term plan of playing d4 ...exd4 Qxd4. The Graz Defence, Classical Defence Deferred, and M\u00f8ller Defence combine 3...a6 with the active move ...Bc5. The Zaitsev Variation (also called the Flohr\u2013ZaitseV Variation) was advocated by Igor ZaitSev, who was one of Karpov's trainers for many years.

    "E20": "The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 e63. Nc3 Bb4. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings, it is classified as E20\u2013E59. It was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. It is a highly respected defence to 1.d4 and has been played by every world champion since Capablanca. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response to 4...e5. The Karpov Variation is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. The Larsen Variation can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Ba5 or 7...Nc6 8a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3 dxc4 10.Bxf4 Qc7 (Main Variation) 7...Dxc4 (Karpov) 8.bxf4 (Smyslov) 8...Bd7 followed by ...Bc6 (Bronstein) After 7...Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Qc7 is the Khasin Variation, named after International Master Abram Khasin. In the Rubinstein, White has often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight, thus avoiding the doubled pawns. There are several move orders to reach the Main Variation besides the one given above; 4.e3 0-0 5.Bd3 d5 6.Ne2 (Modern Variation) 4.e3 c5 is one of the most popular moves in the game. There are two major variations particular to 4...c5: 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3 (6.Ne2 will likely transpose to the Modern Variation) 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 is the H\u00fcbner Variation, popularized by GM Robert H\u00fcBner in the late 1960s and '70s and utilised by Bobby Fischer. The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5. The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. The Capablanca Position was popular in the early days of the Nimzo Position, though eventually superseded by the Rubinstein-Indian Position. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are common replies to 4.Qc2. After 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 b6 7.Bg5 is nowadays the main line of the Classical Variation. After 7...Bb7, White's most straightforward move is 8.f3 preparing e4, but Black can counter with 8...h6 9.Bh4 d5? White has sometimes tried 8.e3 instead. 4...Nc6 is the Z\u00fcrich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. Garry Kasparov used it to great effect against Anatoly Karpov in their 1985 World Championship match. White usually plays on the queenside in this variation, while Black will try to play on the kingside with ...f5 and possibly transferring the c6-knight over to the kingsside after White's d5.

It is regarded as the sister opening of the Nimzo-Indian, since both openings aim to impede White's efforts to gain full control of the center by playing e2\u2013e4. The classical main line of the Queen's Indian, the most frequently played line from the 1950s until 4...Ba6 became popular in the 1980s, usually continues. White has tried various deviations from the main line in an attempt to unbalance the play. These include:8. Bd2, which defends the knight on c3 and threatens a d4\u2013d5 push. 7... exd5, threatening to regain the pawn on d5 or to play Nf5. 6.

    "E29": "The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 e63. Nc3 Bb4. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings, it is classified as E20\u2013E59. It was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. It is a highly respected defence to 1.d4 and has been played by every world champion since Capablanca. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response. The Karpov Variation is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. The Larsen Variation can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Bxc3 dxc4 10.bxc3 Qc7 (Main Variation) or 7...Nc6 8.A3 Ba5 9.Bg5 Bb7 10.Rc1 and 11.Qe2 are good moves for White. After 4.e3 0-0, White has a huge selection of moves to choose from. Black will play a quick ...e5 to pressurize d4. White will try to advance their centre pawns to free their bishops: c4, d5, and f3 followed by e4 are all possible. In general, the main line of the Rubinstein has held up very well for Black, so since the 1980s White has begun to look elsewhere for chances of obtaining an advantage. There are several move orders to reach the Main Variation besides the one given above. 4...c5 is one of the most popular positions in chess. The game can transpose to the main line mentioned above after moves such as 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0. The H\u00fcbner Variation was popularized by Bobby Fischer in his world championship match with Boris Spassky in 1972 with great effect. The Rubinstein Variation is similar in spirit to the Reshevsky Variation: White prevents Black from doubling their pawns. The main variations emerging from these are:5.2 Ba6 (Fischer Variation) 5.2 c5 (Romanakhis Variation), 5.5. Ne4 (The Fischer Variation or Fchetto) or 6.3 Bd3 (Keres) The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5. The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. Black often sets up a Hedgehog formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6), while White will try to pursue a strategy of gaining queenside space with b4 and c5. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are common replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 6.Nf3 Na6) White almost always plays 5.dxc5. The Pirc Variation was not popular during the mid-20th century. It was the discovery of 12.Qd2! which revived this line for White. 4...Nc6 is the Z\u00fcrich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. White usually plays on the queenside in this variation, while Black will try to play on the kingside with ...f5. Garry Kasparov used it to great effect against Anatoly Karpov in their 1985 World Championship match. Today as White, this is a favourite weapon of GM Alexei Barsov.

The earliest known use of the term \"Indian Defence\" was in 1884. 7.0-0 Na6 has seen some popularity recently. The purpose of this move is to transfer the knight to c5 after White's eventual d5. After 7...a5 White plays 8.Bg5 to pin the knight, making it harder for Black to achieve the ...f7\u2013f5 break.

The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20\u201329 in ECO) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. Black can delay playing ...e5, for example 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.Nf3 e5. All irregular responses such as 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category. 1...g5 is an eccentric response known as Myers' Defense after Hugh Myers's advocacy of it in print and actual play.

Black obtains no immediate compensation for the sacrificed pawn. If White plays an early d4, the game will usually transpose into either the Queen's Gambit or an Indian Defence. The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Bobby Fischer used it in Pawn Sacrifice in the climactic game six of the 1972 World Chess Championship versus Boris Spassky. The opening is written in descriptive notation, rather than algebraic, as the former was contemporary in the late 19th century. It is also known as the \"King's English\" and the \"Symmetrical\" Opening. There are several variations of the opening, including the \"Mecking Variation\" Chess is a type of chess. Chess is a complex game of chess with many different moves and strategies. There are many different types of chess moves and positions. Chess can be played by any player.

    "C23": "The Bishop's Opening is a chess opening that begins with the moves:1. e4 e52. Bc4. White attacks Black's f7-square and prevents Black from advancing the d-pawn to d5. By ignoring the beginner's maxim \"develop knights before bishops\", White leaves their f- pawn unblocked, preserving the possibility of f2\u2013f4. It has an affinity with the King's Gambit and the Vienna Game. Transpositions into the Giuoco Piano and the Two Knights Defense and other openings are also possible. The Boden\u2013Kieseritzky Gambit is named after English players and chess writers Samuel Boden and Lionel Kieseritzer. Boden published the first analysis of it in 1851. Black has a solid position with no clear weaknesses, but White has attacking chances and piece activity as compensation for the pawn. The Urusov Gambit can be reached via the Petrov Defence after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4. In practice, Black's lack of development and inability to castle kingside can prove very problematic. Black's most energetic response to the Philidor Variation is the Lewis Countergambit, 3.c3 d5. Black can transpose into the Evans Gambit, for instance by 3.b4 Bxb4 4. c3 Ba5 5.Nf3 Nc6. Other moves are considered inferior since they hamper White's development or leave the queen exposed, leading to loss of tempo.

    "E86": "The King's Indian Defence (or KID) is a common chess opening. It is defined by the following moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 g6. Black intends to follow up with 3...Bg7 and 4...d6 (the Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence arises when Black plays 3...d5 instead and is considered a separate opening) It is a hypermodern opening, where Black deliberately allows White control of the centre with pawns, with the view to subsequently challenge it. The earliest known use of the term \"Indian Defence\" was in 1884. 7.0-0 Na6 has seen some popularity recently. The purpose of this move is to transfer the knight to c5 after White's eventual d5. After 7...a5 White plays 8.Bg5 to pin the knight, making it harder for Black to achieve the ...f7\u2013f5 break. In the Exchange Variation (7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8), White exchanges queens and is content to play for a small, safe advantage in relatively quiet positions. The S\u00e4misch Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3. The game transposes into the Accelerated Dragon variation of the Sicilian Defence. The Classical Defence is 5...0-0 6.Be3 c5 7.dxc5 dxc5 8.Qxd8 (8.e5 Nfd7 9f4 f4 is also possible here, though less often seen) Black's 9.Bxc6 10.5 Nc6 is believed to give sufficient compensation.

By ignoring the beginner's maxim \"develop knights before bishops\", White leaves their f-p pawn unblocked, preserving the possibility of f2\u2013f4. It has an affinity with the King's Gambit and the Vienna Game. Transpositions into the Giuoco Piano and the Two Knights Defense and other openings are also possible. The Boden\u2013Kieseritzky Gambit is named after English players and chess writers Samuel Boden and Lionel Kieserizky. Boden published the first analysis of it in 1851. Black has a solid position with no clear weaknesses, but White has attacking chances and piece activity as compensation for the pawn. The Urusov Gambit can be reached via the Petrov Defence after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.d4 exd4 4.Bc4. Black's lack of development and inability to castle kingside can prove very problematic. Black's most energetic response to the Philidor Variation is the Lewis Countergambit, 3.c3 d5. Black can transpose into the Evans Gambit, for instance by 3.b4 Bxb4 4. c3 Ba5 5.Nf3 Nc6.

    "C15": "The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence between the cities of London and Paris in 1834. Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience, although some lines such as the Winawer Variation can lead to sharp complications. Black's position is often somewhat cramped in the early game; in particular, the pawn on e6 can impede the development of the bishop on c8. Despite the symmetrical pawn structure, White cannot force a draw. An obsession with obtaining one one pawn sometimes results in embarrassment for White. White will often play c2\u2013c2 at some stage to put pressure on Black's d5-pawn. Black can give White an isolated pawn on c4 to give White's pieces greater freedom. The Exchange Variation was recommended by Howard Staunton in the 19th century. Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3. The Advance declined in popularity, however, throughout most of the 20th century until it was revived in the 1980s by GM and prominent opening theoretician Evgeny Sveshnikov. In recent years, GM Alexander Grischuk has championed it successfully at t. 5.c3 Nge7 6.Na3 Nf5.

It was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. It is a highly respected defence to 1.d4 and has been played by every world champion since Capablanca. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response. The Karpov Variation is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. The Larsen Variation can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Bxc3 dxc4 10.bxc3 Qc7 (Main Variation) or 7...Nc6 8.a2 Ba5 (Larsen) or 8...Bd7 followed by ...Bc6 is the Bronstein Variation. The Rubinstein Variation has a huge selection of moves to choose from, and Black must be familiar with all of them. White will try to advance their centre pawns to free their bishops: c4, d5, and f3 followed by e4 are all possible. If Black can prevent White from achieving this, then they will enjoy the better game. In the Rubinstein, White has often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight. 4.e3 c5 is one of the most popular moves in the game. There are two major variations particular to 4...c5: 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3 (6.Ne2 will likely transpose to the Modern Variation) 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 is the H\u00fcbner Variation, popularized by GM Robert H\u00fcBner in the late 1960s and '70s and utilised by Bobby Fischer. The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5. The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. Black often sets up a Hedgehog formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6), while White will try to pursue a strategy of gaining queenside space with b4 and c5. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are all common replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 6.Nf3 Na6) The Pirc Variation was not popular during the mid-20th century, because the lines where Black eventually recaptures with theKnight was reckoned to give Black easy equality. 4...Nc6 is the Z\u00fcrich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. 4...d5 transposes to the Ragozin Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined and 4...b6. The Nimzo/Queen's Indian hybrid line is the most common move that stays within Nimzo-Indian territory. Black has dissolved White's centre, but the bishop on g2 exerts pressure on the black queenside, which White may augment with 9b3.

It is considered a good opening for amateur players who seek a defensive strategy that is simpler and easier to understand than the complex positions that result from an opening such as the French Defence. The most common Black response is 3...exd4 which relieves the central tension, although it gives up the centre. The Hanham Variation aims to maintain Black's pawn on e5, analogously to closed lines of the Ruy Lopez.

The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. The Capablanca Position was popular in the early days of the Nimzo-Indian, though eventually superseded by the Rubinstein-Indian. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are common replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 6.Nf3 Na6) White almost always plays 5.dxc5 (the Pirc Variation) Black can also try 6...Ne4 (see 4.e3 b6) 4...Nc6 is the Z\u00fcrich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. Garry Kasparov used it to great effect against Anatoly Karpov in their 1985 World Championship match. White usually plays on the queenside in this variation, while Black will try to play on the kingside with ...f5.

    "C77": "The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. e4 e52. Nf3 Nc63. Bb5. The opening is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. A common nickname for the opening is \"The Spanish Torture\" The Morphy Defence is the most commonly played third move for Black. 3...a6 is played in over 65 percent of all games beginning with the Ruyopez. Black almost always responds 4...dxc6. White steers clear of the Marshall Attack and any of the anti-Marshall lines. Frank James Marshall used it as a variation against Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca in 1918. The Breyer Variation was recommended by Gyula Breyer as early as 1911. Boris Spassky has a career-plus score with the Breyer. The Chigorin Variation has declined in popularity because Black must spend some time bringing his offside knight on a5 back into the game. The Schliemann Defence is a sharp line in which Black plays for a kingside attack, frequently sacrificing one or two pawns. Henry Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9\u221213=3 (nine wins, thirteen losses, three draws) The world champion Magnus Carlsen played it in the 2014 Chess Olympiad against Ivan \u0160ari\u0107 and lost. The Classical Defence or Cordel Defence (ECO C64), 3...Bc5 is possibly the oldest defence to the Ruy Lopez.",
    "A45": "The Indian Game is a British breed of game chicken. It is a heavy, muscular bird with an unusually broad breast; the eggs are brown. The breed was developed by Sir Walter Gilbert, of Bodmin in Cornwall, in about 1820. It was intended to be a gamecock, but had no aptitude for cockfighting. In the United States the name was changed in the early twentieth century to Cornish. A white variant, the White Cornish, was developed there at about the same time and is much used in modern industrial chicken meat production.",
    "C83": "The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening characterised by the moves 1.e4 e5, 2.Nf3 Nc6, 3.Bb5. It is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura. The Morphy Defence, 3...a6, forces White to retreat or exchange for Black's knight. The most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. White steers clear of the Marshall Attack and any of the anti-Marshall lines. Black defends the e-pawn with 6...d6 instead of driving away the white bishop. The Marshall Attack is the most common move after 11...c6. The Breyer Variation was recommended by Gyula Breyer as early as 1911. Boris Spassky has a career-plus score with the Breyer. Black generally plays 14g6 to stop White's knight going to f5 from going to e4. The main line continues 10d4 Nbd7 11b7 11Nbd2 12.a4, 12.d5, 12b4, or the main line 12.Bb7 or ...Bd7.

    "C48": "The Four Knights Game is a chess opening that begins with the moves:1. e4 e52. Nf3 Nc63. Nc3 Nf6. The opening is fairly popular with beginners who strictly adhere to the opening principle: \"Develop knights before bishops\" It was one of the workhorses in the family of the Open Game, at even the highest levels, until World War I. In the 1990s, this opening saw a renaissance, and is now seen in the praxis of players from beginner to grandmaster. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Nc3 Nf6 is a favourite among younger players due to its simple and easy development. Black can preserve the symmetry by 4...Bc5, leading to the quiet Giuoco Pianissimo. After 4...Nxe4, Black can perform the center fork trick by pseudo-sacrificing a knight with 4... Nxe4!. Then 5.Bxf7+?, though superficially attractive, relinquishes bishop pair and central control to Black. The Halloween Gambit is a chess move. It is one of the most popular chess moves of all time. The game is played in a number of different ways. It can be played in any number of ways, depending on the strategy used.

    "D98": "The Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 g63. Nc3 d5. Black offers White the possibility of 4.cxd5, which may be followed by 4...Nxd5 and 5.e4, giving White an imposing central pawn duo. In classical opening theory this imposing pawn centre was held to give White a large advantage, but the hypermodern school, which was coming to the fore in the 1920s, held that a large pawn centre could be a liability rather than an asset. White can develop their pieces in a number of ways in the Exchange Variation. For decades, theory held that the correct method of  development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4\u2013f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variant with White. The Hungarian Variation, 7...a6, has been championed by Peter Leko. After 7...Nc6, White will most commonly play 8.Be2, followed by 8...e5! The Gr\u00fcnfeld Gambit is not often met in top-flight play today, its usage having declined significantly since its heyday in the 1930s. In statistical databases this variation shows only a slightly higher percentage of White wins and draws, as opposed to the Exchange Variation. Systems in which White delays the development Nc3 are known as the Neo-Gr\u00fcnfield Defence (ECO code D70\u2013D79). Typical move orders are 1.d4 Nf6 2.g3 g6 3.c4 d5 or, more commonly, 1. d4 nf6. 3.f3Chessgames: Neo-Gr\u00fcnfeld 3.g3InternationalFASTNationalGermanyIsraelUnited StatesRetr.  3. f3 is a variant of 3. g3. 3.f2 is a modified version of the 3.3 version.

    "B05": "The opening is named after Alexander Alekhine, who introduced it in the 1921 Budapest tournament in games against Endre Steiner[2] and Fritz S\u00e4misch. Black tempts White's pawns forward to form a broad pawn centre, with plans to undermine and attack the white structure later in the spirit of hypermodern defence. Bobby Fischer used it in two games against Boris Spassky in the World Chess Championship 1972, and Viktor Korchnoi also included the defence in his repertoire. The Four Pawns Attack is White's most ambitious line against the Alekhine's. Black allows White to make several tempo-gaining attacks on the knight. The game can become very sharp since White must either secure an advantage in space or make use of it before Black succeeds in making a successful strike at it. While the main target of Black is d4, the pawn on c4 also can be pressurized considerably via ...Na5. Black must also play vigorously because passive play will be crushed by the white centre. The Voronezh Variation is the most common response to Black's 5...exd6 line. Black usually aims to attack and undermine the white pawn on d4, and possibly c4 as well. After 10.d5 Ne5 Black's knight lacks a target, and will soon be chased out with f2\u2013f4. Other solid moves such as 9...e6, ...Bd7,...Bf5, and ...a5 are possible. Black will often voluntarily surrender by parries with 5Be2 or 5Be3. 4...dxe5 (the Larsen Variation) eliminates the advanced pawn, but brings forward the white knight after 5.Nxe5. Challenging this knight immediately with 5...Nd7 can lead to the sharp sacrificial line 5. Nxe5 Nd7 6.Nxf7!? Kxf7 7.Qh5+ Ke6. White's most popular move is 6.Be2 (6.Bd3!?) when Black continues with either the immediate 6...nd7 or 6...Bf5. In the Two Knights Variation, White immediately accepts doubled pawns after 3...Nxc3 for some compensation. After 4.dxc3 this compensation is rapid piece development. Black must play 4...Nd5, whereupon White will usually challenge the knight with moves like Bc4 and Nc3. The statistics presented by Cox show this variation scoring poorly for White, with all of Black's main defences scoring at least 50%. The first recorded use of the Brooklyn Variation was in 1905 in Vienna where Adolf Aronzowitsch with white checkmated on the 34th move. 2.Nc3 is by far White's most common alternative to 2.e5. The independent Alekhine line is 2...d5, known as the Scandinavian Variation. White gets a large advantage with 3.d4 f6, or 3...e6 4.Nh3 h6 5.Qg4 d5 6.f3 h5 7.Qf4 g5 8.Nxg5 Nxg 5 9.Qxg4 Be7 10.Qe6+! 7.Be2 or 7.Ne2, 7...Bd7 is unpleasant. After 3...d4, Black can choose among 3...Nfd7 (transposing to the Steinitz variation of the French Defence after 4. d4 e6, but 4.e6!? is a sharp alternative), 3...Ne4!?, and even 3....Ng8. 2.Bc4, the Krejczik Variation, is rarely seen, since it allows Black to gain the bishop pair and seize space in the centre. After 2...Nxe4 3.Bxf7+ (the Krejcik Gambit) Kxf7 4.Qh5+ Kg8 or 4...g6 5.Qd5+ e6 6.Qxe4 Bg7 7.Qf4 Ke8! \"Black has nothing to worry about,\" says Alburt and Schiller.",
    "D53": "The Queen's Gambit Declined is a chess opening in which Black declines a pawn offered by White. The Orthodox Line is the most common variation of the opening. Other variations have their own names and are usually treated separately. The opening became a topical topic after its adoption by Mikhail Botvinnik in his 1963 match with Tigran Petrosian. Black will often aim for the pawn break ...c5 in this opening, which leads to one or the other side accepting isolated or hanging pawns in exchange for dynamic compensation. White has several ways of dealing with Black's setup. White can transpose to the Semi-Slav. or the Ragozin Variation. The Cambridge Springs Defense was introduced more than a century ago, and is still popular among amateurs. Black can fall into several traps, for example the Elephant Trap. Black has a back-up plan if White tries to play the Orthodox Defense. White has two main moves: 8.Bd3 and 8.Rc1 c6. The Three Knights Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined is usually reached from the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3, played to avoid the Nimzo-Indian Defense. The Vienna Variation occurs after Black plays 4...dxc4 in the Three Knightsvariation. An important line in this variation is the Endgame Line where the game continues. This line has been played by top grandmasters such as Wesley So, Anish Giri, and Magnus Carlsen aiming for a draw. Placing the bishop on Bg5 allows Black to exchange more freely with moves like Nf6-e4. The move Bf4 is designed to restrict Black's opportunities in this way. Play usually continues with 5...0-0 6.e3 c5 7.dxc5 Bxc5.[19] Peter Leko, usually an e4 player, used this variation as White to beat Vladimir Kramnik in their 2004 World Championship Match. The Three Knights Variation is also a popular line.",

The opening's current highest-rated proponent is GM Vassily Ivanchuk, although Lev Alburt played it almost exclusively during his career. The Four Pawns Attack is White's most ambitious line against the Alekhine's. Black allows White to make several tempo-gaining attacks on the knight. The game can become very sharp since White must either secure an advantage in space or make use of it before Black succeeds in making a successful strike at it. Black must also play vigorously because passive play will be crushed by the white centre. An alternative is the sharp Planinc Variation (also known as the Cambridge Gambit), 5...g5!? Black hopes for 6.fxg5? dxe5. The Voronezh Variation is named after the Russian city where the line was invented. It is defined by the opening sequence 1.e4 Nf6 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.exd6 cxd6 6.Nc3 g6 7.Be3 Bg7 8.Rc1 0-0 9.Bg5 9.Nd5 Ne5 10.dxe5 dxe5 11.Qxd8 Rxd8 12.c5 N6d7 (This retreat is forced since 12...Nc6?? loses the knight due to the 13.Rd1 pin) Black must play carefully to unentangle the white pawn on c5. 4...dxe5 (the Larsen Variation) eliminates the advanced pawn, but brings forward the white knight after 5.Nxe5. Challenging this knight immediately with 5...Nd7 can lead to the sharp sacrificial line 5. Nxe5 Nd7 6.Nxf7!? Kxf7 7.Qh5+ Ke6. White usually replies with 5.Bc4, the Keres Variation. 4...g6, preparing to fianchetto a bishop to oppose White's central pawn mass, is also often seen.

The John Tracy Gambit is a poor choice, leading to the loss of the king pawn for doubtful compensation. The Latvian Gambit can in effect wind up playing it after 1.e4 Nf6 2.f3 e5 3.f4!?.",
    "B34": "The Sicilian Defence is the most popular and best-scoring response to White's first move 1.e4. It is named after Giulio Cesare Polerio, who analysed it in his 1594 book King's Pawn Game. Black's c5-pawn is traded for White's d4-p pawn in the early stages of the game. The pawn trade also opens the c-file for Black, who can place a rook or queen on that file. Black can then choose between four major variations: the Najdorf, Dragon, Classical and Scheveningen. The Sveshnikov Variation was pioneered by Evgeny SvesHnikov and Gennadi Timoshchenko in the 1970s. The old main line 7.Nb3 is now less popular than the modern 7.nf3. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov\u2013Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986. Black's move 2...e6 gives priority to developing the dark-squared bishop. White can play 2.Nf3 without intending to follow up with 3.d4. Black sometimes plays 3...e5 to avoid both moves; then 4.Bc4 is considered White's best move. The Sicilian Defence is one of the most popular chess openings, named after the Sicilian city of Sveshnikov. It can be played with the Tal Gambit Declined or the Najdorf Variation, both of which are named after places in the city of\u00a0Najdorf."
