    "D48": "Semi-Slav Defense is a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined chess opening. It is defined by the position reached after the moves:1. d4 d52. c4 c63. Nf3 Nf64. Nc3 e6. After 3.Nf3 Nf6 White has the option of entering the Catalan opening with 4.g3. Black has the opportunity to respond with 3...e6 instead of 3...Nf6. White now has a number of possible continuations, including 5.a4 (see below) The Meran is a chess variation that was first played in 1906 in Schlechter\u2013Perlis. The variation takes its name from the town of Meran (Merano) in northern Italy. White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. Black's main plan, on the other hand, is to find a way to push ...c6\u2013c5. The modern version of the Meran is played after 8...Bb7. The idea behind this move is to develop the light-squared bishop and possibly play b5\u2013b4 and c6\u2013c5 without wasting time on a7\u2013a6. The move was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line 9.e4 b4. The game becomes wildly tactical and provides opportunities for both sides. White's strategic idea in the Meran is to push e3\u2013e4, and with a bishop on d6 Black is always ready to meet this with e6\u2013e5. Black commonly replies with 6...Bd6. White can choose between a couple of very different continuations. The Anti-Meran Gambit is a variation of the Queen's Gambit. It has been used by several grandmasters, including Kasparov, who won the first game of his 2003 match against the computer chess program Deep Junior with it. Moscow Variation 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character from the Botvinnik or Anti-Moscow Variations. Black aims to benefit from the slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. The Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced by Mikhail Botvinik in the 1945 USSR vs. USA radio match vs. Arnold Denker. The Botvinnik Variation is one of the most difficult variations of the Queen's Gambit Declined. The main continuation is 11...Bb7 12.Bg2 Qb6 13.exf6 0-0-0 14.0- 0 c5 (14...Ne5 is also an option): White can simply capture 15.dxe5, and while Black wins the queen after 15...Rxd1 16.Raxd1, White seems to have the upper hand at least according to engines. The most challenging continuation is 16.Na4, where Black has two main replies: 16...Qa6 and 16...Na4. After 5.g3, White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with 5...dxc4. White will continue 6.Bg2 (6.a4 c5 is supposed to be good for Black), and Black has now two main choices. First, he can play 6...b5, and the game might continue in Catalan style with 7.Ne5 a6 8.A4 (8.Nxc6 Qb6 is fine for Black) Bb7 and so on. After 7.Qd3, Black's best reply is considered to be 7...a68.e4 c4 or 9.e5.",

It is one of Black's most reliable defenses to 1.d4. White has several ways of dealing with Black's setup. The Cambridge Springs Defense was introduced more than a century ago, and is still popular among amateurs. Black can fall into several traps, for example, the Elephant Trap. White has alternatives to 4.Nf3 such as the Marshall Gambit 4.e4 and the Stonewall Dutch after ...f5. The Three Knights Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined is usually reached from the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3, played to avoid the Nimzo-Indian Defense. The Vienna Variation occurs after Black plays 4...dxc4 in the Three Knight's Variation. Placing the bishop on Bg5 allows Black to exchange more freely with moves like Nf6-e4. The move Bf4 is designed to restrict Black's opportunities in this way. Play usually continues with 5...0-0 6.e3 c5 7.dxc5 Bxc5.

The variation takes its name from the town of Meran (Merano) in northern Italy. White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. Black's main plan is to find a way to push ...c6\u2013c5. The Meran is a game of chess played with bishops and pawns. Black typically develops his queen with ...Qc7, with the choice of whether or not to push the c-pawn to c4. White has the option of playing 10.d5, which often transposes to the Reynolds Attack (described in detail below) Continuing the game with 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 is still very much an option for White. Instead of captures on c5, White can play 12.0-0 with some attacking prospects. The most critical continuation is 12...cxd4 after which White can either play 13.Re1 or 13.Nxd4, both giving opportunity for some wild attacks on the black position. White can immediately push 11.e4, and Black must respond with the thematic 11...e5. Black players have tried various approaches to combat White's plan, and the final word on this variation has certainly not yet been said. After 11...Qe7, White can continue 12. e4 e5 13.Bg5, and White seems to retain some advantage. 5...h6 leads to 5...Nbd7 (transposing to the Cambridge Springs Defense), 5...dxc4 (triggering the ultra-sharp Botvinnik Variation) or 5...Be7.

Black aims to benefit from slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. The Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations.

The Botvinnik Variation is a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined. White has two main continuations: 16.Na4 and 16.Rb1. The most challenging continuation is 16...Na4, where Black has two. main replies. Black breaks the pin on the h4\u2013d8 diagonal and forms a pin of his own on the c3-knight. After 5.g3, White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with 5...dxc4. After 7.Qb3, the game might continue 7...Nbd7 8.Bg5 Be7 9.e3 with equal opportunities.

It is named after Giulio Cesare Polerio, who wrote about it in 1594. Black's c5-pawn is traded for White's d4-p pawn in the early stages of the game. Black can then choose between four major variations: the Najdorf, Dragon, Classical, and Scheveningen. Black usually plays 6...e6 (ECO B88 transposed) to limit the range of White's bishop. The Sicilian Defence is one of the most popular openings in chess. The opening is named after the city of Sicilian. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov\u2013Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986. Black's move 2...e6 gives priority to developing the dark-squared bishop. Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 ( the Kan Variation) and 4 ...Nf6. White generally answers with 6.Bd3, supporting the e4-pawn. The Pin Variation (also called the Sicilian Counter-Attack) is considered theoretically suspect, but if White is unprepared the tactics can be difficult to calculate at the board.",
    "E35": "The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 e63. Nc3 Bb4. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings, it is classified as E20\u2013E59. This hypermodern opening was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch in the early 20th century. It can also transpose into lines of the Queen's Gambit or Queen's Indian Defence. Black's delay in committing to a pawn structure makes it a very flexible defence to 1.d4. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response to 4...e5. The Karpov Variation is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. The Larsen Variation (named after GM Bent Larsen) can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Ba5 or 7...Nc6 8.A3 Bxc3 dxc3 9.bxc3 Qc7 (Main Variation) The Main Variation was enormously popular in the 1950s. After 7...Nc6 8.a3 Bxc3 9.bxc3 dxc4 10.Bxc4 Qc7 is the Khasin Variation, named after International Master Abram Khasin. In the Rubinstein, White has often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight, thus avoiding the doubled pawns. The Averbakh Variation (7...Nbd7) was popularized by GMs Viacheslav Ragozin and Yuri A verbakh. Black will try to restrain White's centre as well as they can, ideally blockading it. 4...c5 is one of the most popular moves in chess. The game can still transpose to the main line mentioned above after moves such as 5.Bd3 d5 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0. The H\u00fcbner Variation was popularized by Bobby Fischer in his world championship match with Boris Spassky in 1972 with great effect in game 5. The Rubinstein Variation is similar in spirit to the Reshevsky Variation: White prevents Black from doubling their pawns. The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5. The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. Black often sets up a Hedgehog formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6), while White will try to pursue a strategy of gaining queenside space with b4 and c5. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are common replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 6.Nf3 Na6) White almost always plays 5.dxc5. The Pirc Variation was not popular during the mid-20th century. It was the discovery of 12.Qd2! which revived this line for White. 4...Nc6 is the Z\u00fcrich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. 4...d5 transposes to the Ragozin Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined and 4...b6. The Nimzo/Queen's Indian hybrid line is the most common move that stays within Nimzo-Indian territory. After 6.Nf3 Qf5 7.Qxf5 exf5, Black strengthens his grip on e4 and makes e6 available for the bishop.",
    "A51": "The Budapest Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 e5. The first known game with the gambit is Adler\u2013Mar\u00f3czy (played in Budapest in 1896) It enjoyed a rise in popularity in the early 1920s, but nowadays is rarely played at the top level. It experiences a lower percentage of draws than other main lines, but also a lower overall performance for Black. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game or cripple White's pawn structure. Black can easily get several pieces around the white king, notably a rook to h6, a queen to h4 and a knight on g4. The game will take an entirely different structure depending on whether Black gives up the bishop pair or tries to keep it. The Budapest Gambit is a move that involves pawn advances on the queenside. Black can then force mate in 8 moves by winning this weak pawn. The Gambit can be played in a variety of ways, including the Exchange Variation of the French Defence, the Rubinstein line, and the Ra8\u2013a8 manoeuvre. It is called the \"soul of the game\" and is played by GMs Wu Shaobin and Ashot Nadanian. It has been described as the \"most difficult game in chess\" to master. Black mates with either 31.Kf5 g6+ 32.KF6 Bd4 mate, or 31. Kf3 Rf2 mate. The Budapest gambit was referenced in season 28, episode 15, of The Simpsons, in an episode called \"The Cad and the Hat\"",
    "C63": "The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. e4 e52. Nf3 Nc63. Bb5. The opening is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy L\u00f3pez de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. The Morphy Defence is the most common Black move after 3...a6. White's objective in playing the Ruyopez is to spoil Black's pawn structure. It was included in the G\u00f6ttingen manuscript, which dates from c. 1490. The most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. Black almost always responds 4...dxc6. The Pilnik Variation, named for Hermann Pilnik, is also known as the Teichmann Variation. White plays 9.d3 intending to later advance to d4 under favourable circumstances. With 9...Bb7 Black prepares to put more pressure on e4 after 10.d4 Re8. The Berlin and Schliemann Defences are the most popular today, followed by the Classical Defence. Henry Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9\u221213=3 (nine wins, thirteen losses, three draws) The world champion Magnus Carlsen played it in the 2014 Chess Olympiad against Ivan \u0160ari\u0107 and lost. White's most important continuations after 4...Bc5 are 5.0-0, 5.Bxc6, and 5.c3.",

Most commonly played third move for Black is the Morphy Defence, 3...a6, a move that forces White to retreat or exchange for Black's knight. The theory of the Ruyopez is the most extensively developed of all Open Games. The most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. Black almost always responds 4...dxc6. In the Worrall Attack (ECO C86), White replaces 6.Re1 with 6.Qe2. The Breyer Variation was recommended by Gyula Breyer as early as 1911. Boris Spassky has a career-plus score with the Breyer. The main line continues 10d4 Nbd7 11Nbd2 12.a4, 12.d5, 12b4, or the main line 12.Bb7 or ...Bd7. The Steinitz Defence (3...d6) is solid but passive and cramped. Henry Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9\u221213=3 (nine wins, thirteen losses, three draws) The world champion Magnus Carlsen played it in the 2014 Chess Olympiad against Ivan \u0160ari\u0107 and lost. The Classical Defence or Cordel Defence (ECO C64), 3...Bc5 is possibly the oldest defence to the Ruy Lopez.",
    "E61": "The Indian Game is a British breed of game chicken. It is a heavy, muscular bird with an unusually broad breast. It was developed by Sir Walter Gilbert, of Bodmin in Cornwall, in about 1820. In the United States the name was changed in the early twentieth century to Cornish. A white variant, the White Cornish, was developed there at about the same time, and is much used in modern industrial chicken meat production in many parts of the world. The Indian Game was bred as a gamecock, but was not successful as a fighting bird.",

    "A05": "The King's Indian Attack is a chess opening system where White adopts the setup more commonly seen being played by Black in the King'sIndian Defence. The King's India Attack is characterised by the following moves: the central pawns are developed to e4 and d3, the knights are develop to d2 and f3, and White castles kingside. It is a closed, strategic opening that presents its practitioner with common themes and tactics and a comfortable middlegame against various defences. Black's strategy differs from standard French Defence lines because the e5-pawn will be defended by pieces rather than pawns. After 1.e4 e6, the game might typically proceed as follows: 4.Ngf3 Nf6 5.g3 Nc6 6.Bg2 Be7 7.0-0 0-0 8.Re1 (see diagram in previous section) White will now look to play e4\u2013e5, cramping Black, and then proceed with moves such as Nf1, Bf4, Qe2, h4, N1h2 (or Ne3), h5, g4 (or Ng4) The Kings Indian Attack setup is also sometimes employed against the Caro\u2013Kann Defence.

    "C08": "The French Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1.e4 e6, 2.d4 d5, 3.Nc3 or 3.e5. Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience, although some lines such as the Winawer Variation can lead to sharp complications. Black's natural French Defence move 6...c5 runs into 7.Bxe7 when Black must either move the king with 7...Kxe7 or allow 7...Qxe7. The McCutcheon Variation is named for John Lindsay McCutheon of Philadelphia (1857\u20131905), who brought the variation to public attention when he used it to defeat World Champion Steinitz in a simultaneous exhibition in Manhattan in 1885. The Advance Variation is frequently played in the early days of the French Defence. It has the reputation of giving immediate equality to Black due to the symmetrical pawn structure. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings includes an alphanumeric classification system for openings that is widely use.  briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3. It is also known as the Black Variation and the White Variation, and has been used in a number of chess games since the early 1980s.

    "E92": "The King's Indian Defence (or KID) is a common chess opening. It is defined by the following moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 g6. Black intends to follow up with 3...Bg7 and 4...d6 (the Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence arises when Black plays 3...d5 instead and is considered a separate opening) White's major third move options are 3.Nc3, 3.nf3 or 3.g3. Black stakes out their own claim to the centre with the Benoni-style ...c5. 7.0-0 Na6 has seen some popularity recently. The purpose of this move is to transfer the knight to c5 after White's eventual d5. After 7...a5 White plays 8.Bg5 to pin the knight, making it harder for Black to achieve the ...f7\u2013f5 break. In the Exchange Variation (7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8), White exchanges queens and is content to play for a small, safe advantage in relatively quiet positions. The S\u00e4misch Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3. Black has a variety of pawn breaks, such as ...e5, ...c5 and ...b5 (prepared by ...c6 and/or ...a6) This can transpose to the Modern Benoni after 5...0-0 6.Bg5 c5 7.d5 e6. Black can strike for the centre as previously mentioned or delay with 6...Nc6, 7...a6 and 8...Rb8. The Averbakh Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Be2 0-0 6.Bg5. The Fianchetto Variation 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3. nf3 Bf3 4.g3 0-1 5.bg2 d6 6.0-0 is named for White's development of light-squared bishop to g2.

    "A02": "Bird's Opening is a standard flank opening. It is named after 19th century English player Henry Bird. Black may challenge White's plan to control e5 immediately by playing From's Gambit (1...e5) The opening was mentioned by Luis Ram\u00edrez de Lucena in his book Repetici\u00f3n de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez con Cien Juegos de Partido, published c. 1497. It was sometimes played by La Bourdonnais and Elijah Williams in the mid-nineteenth century. International Master (IM) Timothy Taylor recommends 3.Nc3! Nxe5 4.d4 intending 5.e4, rather than 3.nf3?! g5! when Black stands well. Emanuel Lasker introduced 4...g5 in the game Bird\u2013Lasker, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1892. White has a large advantage in all lines, although play remains extremely sharp, e.g. 13...Rde8 14.Nd2 14.Kd1 Bxh2 16.exf5! Re8 17.fxg6! Qxe3 18.Qxe3 Rxe3 19.gxf7; or 13...Bd7 (threatening 14...Rxh 2!) 14.Bf2! The offbeat 1...b6!? is also known, and more soundly based than the same move after 1.e4 or 1.d4. The Swiss Gambit was named by Alexander Wagner (1868\u20131942), a Polish chess player and openings analyst who introduced it in the Swiss correspondence game Wagner\u2013Kostin, 1910\u201311. Another offbeat try is Martin Appleberry's 1...Nh6!?, also known as the Horsefly, which exploits the closed c1-h6 diagonal. 1.f4 ranks sixth in popularity in Chessgames.com's database, behind 1.e4, 1.d4,1.Nf3, 1,c4, and 1.g3. It is less than one-twentieth as popular as the mirror image English Opening (1.c4) The move slightly weakens White's king's position. Black's most successful response to Bird's Opening in that rating range is e5, where Black's win percentage is 50-46%, but that evens to 48-48% when White plays 2.fxe5. Chess is a popular game of chess. Chess tournaments include the Chess Olympiad, the Chess World Cup and the Chess Grand Prix. Chess is popular in the arts, literature and the sciences. Chess has its roots in ancient Persia and medieval Europe. Chess was first played in Germany in the 17th century. It is still played today in Germany and other European countries. Chess can be played in many different ways, including the traditional two-knights defense and the two-pawn defence.",
    "C30": "The King's Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves:1.e4 e5 2.f4. It was one of the most popular openings until the late 19th century, when improvements in defensive technique led to its decline in popularity. It is infrequently seen at master level today, as Black has several methods to obtain equality, but is still popular at amateur level. In 2012, an April Fools' Day prank by Chessinventor Ryik Rajlich claimed to have proven to a 99.9999% certainty that a draw is at best possible. The main continuations for White are 3.Nf3 (King's Knight's Gambit) and 3.Bc4 (Bishop'sGambit) Black usually accepts the gambit pawn. The Classical Defense (2...Bc5) and the Falkbeer Countergambit are also popular. Black may play safely with 6...Nh6 (Silberschmidt Variation or counter-sacrifice) after 5h4 d6 or the Philidor Gambit after 4...Bg7. The Quaade Gambit (3.Nf3 g5 4.Nc3) is named after a Danish amateur who discussed it in correspondence with the Deutsche Schachzeitung in the 1880s. The move has received renewed attention following its recommendation by John Shaw in his 2013 book on the King's Gambit. A well-known trap here is 4...g4 5.Ne5 Qh4+ 6.g3 fxg3 7.Qxg4 g2+? The Fischer Defense (3.Nf3 d6), although previously known, was advocated by Bobby Fischer after he was defeated by Boris Spassky in a Kieseritzky Gambit at the 1960 Mar del Plata tournament. The Abbazia Defense has much the same idea as the Falkbeer Countergambit, and can in fact be reached via transposition, i.e. 2...d5 3.exd5 exf4 4. nf3. The Bishop's Gambit is the most important. Black's other main option is 3...d5, returning the pawn immediately. John Shaw wrote that 3...Nc6 is a \"refutation\" of the Bishop's Gambit, as he says that Black is better in all variations. The Falkbeer Countergambit is named after the 19th-century Austrian master Ernst Falkbeer. It runs 1.e4 e5 2.f4 d5 3.exd5 e4, in which Black sacrifices a pawn in return for quick and easy development. The King's Gambit is one of the oldest countergambits in Chess. It is considered dubious because 3.exf5 with the threat of Qh5+ gives White a good game. The variation is sometimes named the Pantelidakis Countergambit because GM Larry Evans answered a question about it in Chess Life and Review. White may also offer the gambit in the Bishop's Opening, e.g. 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4, though this is uncommon."
