    "D48": "Semi-Slav Defense is a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined chess opening. It is defined by the position reached after the moves:1. d4 d52. c4 c63. Nf3 Nf64. Nc3 e6. After 3.Nf3 Nf6 White has the option of entering the Catalan opening with 4.g3. Black has the opportunity to respond with 3...e6 instead of 3...Nf6. White now has a number of possible continuations, including 5.a4 (see below) The Meran is a chess variation that was first played in 1906 in Schlechter\u2013Perlis. The variation takes its name from the town of Meran (Merano) in northern Italy. White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. Black's main plan, on the other hand, is to find a way to push ...c6\u2013c5. The modern version of the Meran is played after 8...Bb7. The idea behind this move is to develop the light-squared bishop and possibly play b5\u2013b4 and c6\u2013c5 without wasting time on a7\u2013a6. The move was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line 9.e4 b4. The game becomes wildly tactical and provides opportunities for both sides. White's strategic idea in the Meran is to push e3\u2013e4, and with a bishop on d6 Black is always ready to meet this with e6\u2013e5. Black commonly replies with 6...Bd6. White can choose between a couple of very different continuations. The Anti-Meran Gambit is a variation of the Queen's Gambit. It has been used by several grandmasters, including Kasparov, who won the first game of his 2003 match against the computer chess program Deep Junior with it. Moscow Variation 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character from the Botvinnik or Anti-Moscow Variations. Black aims to benefit from the slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. The Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced by Mikhail Botvinik in the 1945 USSR vs. USA radio match vs. Arnold Denker. The Botvinnik Variation is one of the most difficult variations of the Queen's Gambit Declined. The main continuation is 11...Bb7 12.Bg2 Qb6 13.exf6 0-0-0 14.0- 0 c5 (14...Ne5 is also an option): White can simply capture 15.dxe5, and while Black wins the queen after 15...Rxd1 16.Raxd1, White seems to have the upper hand at least according to engines. The most challenging continuation is 16.Na4, where Black has two main replies: 16...Qa6 and 16...Na4. After 5.g3, White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with 5...dxc4. White will continue 6.Bg2 (6.a4 c5 is supposed to be good for Black), and Black has now two main choices. First, he can play 6...b5, and the game might continue in Catalan style with 7.Ne5 a6 8.A4 (8.Nxc6 Qb6 is fine for Black) Bb7 and so on. After 7.Qd3, Black's best reply is considered to be 7...a68.e4 c4 or 9.e5.",

It is one of Black's most reliable defenses to 1.d4. White has several ways of dealing with Black's setup. The Cambridge Springs Defense was introduced more than a century ago, and is still popular among amateurs. Black can fall into several traps, for example, the Elephant Trap. White has alternatives to 4.Nf3 such as the Marshall Gambit 4.e4 and the Stonewall Dutch after ...f5. The Three Knights Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined is usually reached from the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3, played to avoid the Nimzo-Indian Defense. The Vienna Variation occurs after Black plays 4...dxc4 in the Three Knight's Variation. Placing the bishop on Bg5 allows Black to exchange more freely with moves like Nf6-e4. The move Bf4 is designed to restrict Black's opportunities in this way. Play usually continues with 5...0-0 6.e3 c5 7.dxc5 Bxc5.

After 3.Nf3 Nf6 White has the option of entering the Catalan opening with 4.g3. Black has the opportunity to respond with 3...e6 instead of 3...Nf6. White now has a number of possible continuations, including 5.a4 (see below) and 5.e3. The Meran is a chess variation first played in 1906 in Schlechter\u2013Perlis. The variation takes its name from the town of Meran (Merano) in northern Italy. White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. Black's main plan is to find a way to push ...c6\u2013c5. The Meran is a game of chess played with bishops and pawns. Black typically develops his queen with ...Qc7, with the choice of whether or not to push the c-pawn to c4. White has the option of playing 10.d5, which often transposes to the Reynolds Attack (described in detail below) Continuing the game with 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 is still very much an option for White. Instead of captures on c5, White can play 12.0-0 with some attacking prospects. The most critical continuation is 12...cxd4 after which White can either play 13.Re1 or 13.Nxd4, both giving opportunity for some wild attacks on the black position. White can immediately push 11.e4, and Black must respond with the thematic 11...e5. Black players have tried various approaches to combat White's plan, and the final word on this variation has certainly not yet been said. After 11...Qe7, White can continue 12. e4 e5 13.Bg5, and White seems to retain some advantage. 5...h6 leads to 5...Nbd7 (transposing to the Cambridge Springs Defense), 5...dxc4 (triggering the ultra-sharp Botvinnik Variation) or 5...Be7. Main Black replies are (in order of frequency in high-level games): 5... h6 (immediately questioning the white bishop's intentions, leading to Moscow/Anti-Moscow variations) 5...H6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character from the BotVinnik or Anti-Moscow Variations. Black aims to benefit from slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. The Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced by Mikhail BotVinnik in the 1945 USSR vs. USA radio match vs. Arnold Denker. Black makes the thematic pawn capture 5...dxc4 immediately. The Botvinnik Variation is a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined. White has two main continuations: 16.Na4 and 16.Rb1. The most challenging continuation is 16...Na4, where Black has two. main replies. Black breaks the pin on the h4\u2013d8 diagonal and forms a pin of his own on the c3-knight. After 5.g3, White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with 5...dxc4. After 7.Qb3, the game might continue 7...Nbd7 8.Bg5 Be7 9.e3 with equal opportunities. Black's best reply is considered to be 7...a6 8.e4 c5 and Black is supposed to be fine after either 9.dxc5 or 9. e5.",
