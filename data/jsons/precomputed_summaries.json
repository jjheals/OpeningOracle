After 1.e4 c5 there are three options for Black: 2...d6, 2...Nc6, and 2...e6. The Smith-Morra Gambit is named after Pierre Morra and Ken Smith, who helped popularize the opening. Black can either castle kingside with 7.Bb3 a6 or 8.0-0 (the Fischer\u2013Sozin Attack) Black can also try Benko's move 6...Qb6, which forces White to make a decision over the d4-knight. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4, the Mar\u00f3czy Bind. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3, Black has some less commonly played options apart from 2...d6, 2...Nc6 and 2...e6. White's strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3. Many lines transpose to the Open Sicilian, the Moscow Variation or the Rossolimo Variation. White can play the positional 5.Bb5, threatening to double Black's pawns with Bxc6. The Sicilian Defence is classified under the codes B20 through B99. White may decline the gambit with 3. nc3, called the \"Toilet Variation\", so named after its reputed place of invention.",
    "D48": "The Semi-Slav Defense is a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined chess opening. It is defined by the position reached after the moves:1. d4 d52. c4 c63. Nf3 Nf64. Nc3 e6. After the move order 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Black has the opportunity to respond with 3...e6 instead of 3...Nf6. This \"triangle setup\" opens up some new alternatives for both players on the fourth move. The Meran Variation is one of the main variations of the Semi-Slav. White plays 6.Bd3, provoking the continuation 6...dxc4 7.Bxc4 b5. The line was first played in 1906 in the game Schlechter\u2013Perlis. The variation takes its name from the town of Meran in northern Italy. 8...Bb7 was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 12.Nxc5 Nxc5 13.dxc5 Bxc5 14.Bb5+ and the black king will be stuck in the center. But after 14...Ke7 Black is completely fine and might be even better, with a very strong knight on d5 and strong bishops aiming at the White kingside. Black keeps his c-pawn on c5 is: 11...Qc7 12.dxe6 fxe6 13.Ng5 Qc6 after which there are many different ways to continue for both sides. White's strategic idea in the Meran is to push e3\u2013e4, and with a bishop on d6 Black is always ready to meet this with e6\u2013e5, and typically Black is doing fine after such moves. Most often White players choose the move 7.Bd3. Karpov first played 7.Be2 but it soon transpired that the d3-square gives White better chances. Play often continues 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.h3 with some slight advantage for White. If Black simply takes the pawn with 7...Nxg4, White will respond with 8.Rg1. Black now has a number of playable continuations, including Qf6, Nxh2, f5, h5 and Nh6. The Moscow Variation 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character. Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings. The opening was introduced by Mikhail Botvinnink in 1945. The game typically continues 6...dxc4 7.e4 (note: 7.a4 to prevent Black's b5 does not work) The Botvinnik Variation was invented by Klaus Junge, but he was not the first person known to have played it. Black makes the thematic pawn capture 5...dxc4 immediately. White will fianchetto his king bishop and castle kingside, while Black will play ...c5, ...Qb6, castle queenside. More than 90% of games continue with 5.Bg5 or 5.e3, but there are some sidelines that are worth a quick look. The move 5.Qb3 is an alternative way of protecting the c-pawn. If Black plays 5...dxc4 instead, White will recapture with 6.Qxc4.

The Three Knights Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined is usually reached from the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3, played to avoid the Nimzo-Indian Defense (from the white point of view) and the Exchange Variation. The Vienna Variation occurs after Black plays 4...dxc4. The Semi-Slav Defense occurs after black plays 4...c6 in the Three Knights Variation.

At the 1927 New York tournament, world champion Jose Raul Capablanca used it as his main weapon against 1.e4. In his 1958 rematch with GM Vassily Smyslov, GM Mikhail Botvinnik became the first player to use it in a match for the world championship. The Caro\u2013Kann has a reputation of being solid but somewhat boring. Black makes very few compromises in pawn structure and plays a timely ...c6\u2013c5 to contest the d4-square.

The variation takes its name from the town of Meran in northern Italy. 8...Bb7 was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 12.Nxc5 Nxc5 13.dxc5 Bxc5 14.Bb5+ and the black king will be stuck in the center. But after 14...Ke7 Black is completely fine and might be even better, with a very strong knight on d5 and strong bishops aiming at the White kingside. Black keeps his c-pawn on c5 is: 11...Qc7 12.dxe6 fxe6 13.Ng5 Qc6 after which there are many different ways to continue for both sides. White's strategic idea in the Meran is to push e3\u2013e4, and with a bishop on d6 Black is always ready to meet this with e6\u2013e5, and typically Black is doing fine after such moves. Most often White players choose the move 7.Bd3. Karpov first played 7.Be2 but it soon transpired that the d3-square gives White better chances. Play often continues 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.h3 with some slight advantage for White. If Black simply takes the pawn with 7...Nxg4, White will respond with 8.Rg1. Black now has a number of playable continuations, including Qf6, Nxh2, f5, h5 and Nh6. The Moscow Variation 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character. Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings. The opening was introduced by Mikhail Botvinnink in 1945. The game typically continues 6...dxc4 7.e4 (note: 7.a4 to prevent Black's b5 does not work) The Botvinnik Variation was invented by Klaus Junge, but he was not the first person known to have played it. Black makes the thematic pawn capture 5...dxc4 immediately. White will fianchetto his king bishop and castle kingside, while Black will play ...c5, ...Qb6, castle queenside. More than 90% of games continue with 5.Bg5 or 5.e3, but there are some sidelines that are worth a quick look. The move 5.Qb3 is an alternative way of protecting the c-pawn. If Black plays 5...dxc4 instead, White will recapture with 6.Qxc4.

    "B80": "The Sicilian Defence was analysed by Giulio Polerio in his 1594 manuscript on chess. It is used by world champions Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov. Black's most common move after 2.Nf3 is ...Nf6, followed by 2...e6. The immediate 5...e5?! is met by 6.Bb5+!, when Black must either play 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7. White's idea is to play f3, Qd2, 0-0-0 and g4 in some order. Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 ( the Kan Variation) and 4...E5. Black sometimes plays 3...e4 to avoid both moves; then 4...Bc4 is considered best. 2...Nc6 is the most common choice, but 2...e6 and 2...d6 are often played. Main line of the Closed Sicilian is 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.d3 d6 (diagram) Black's best reply is 2...exd5 3.5! Nf6!, the Talbit Gambit, which has caused 2f4 to decline in popularity. White can play the positional 5.Bb5, threatening to double Black's pawns. The modern main line runs 2. nc2 Nc2 3. f4 g4 4.f4 g6 5.Nf3 Bg3.",

    "D14": "The Slav Defense is one of the primary defenses to the Queen's Gambit. It was analyzed as early as 1590, but not explored extensively until the 1920s. Many masters of Slavic descent helped develop the theory of this opening, including Alapin, Alekhine and Bogoljubov. After 3...Nf6, the main line is 4.Nc3. Black can try the Winawer Countergambit, 3...e5, which was introduced in Marshall\u2013Winawer, Monte Carlo 1901 but this is thought to be slightly better for White. White can also try the following alternatives:4.Qc2 or 4.Qb3. Another way to play is 4...Bg4. White's sharpest try against 4...dxc4 is the Slav Geller Gambit, 5.e4. With 5.a4, White acts against ...b5 and prepares 6.e 4 and 7.Bxc4. Black's main move is 5...Bf5.",
