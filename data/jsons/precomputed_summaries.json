After 1.e4 c5 there are three options for Black: 2...d6, 2...Nc6, and 2...e6. The Smith-Morra Gambit is named after Pierre Morra and Ken Smith, who helped popularize the opening. Black can either castle kingside with 7.Bb3 a6 or 8.0-0 (the Fischer\u2013Sozin Attack) Black can also try Benko's move 6...Qb6, which forces White to make a decision over the d4-knight. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4, the Mar\u00f3czy Bind. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3, Black has some less commonly played options apart from 2...d6, 2...Nc6 and 2...e6. White's strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3. Many lines transpose to the Open Sicilian, the Moscow Variation or the Rossolimo Variation. White can play the positional 5.Bb5, threatening to double Black's pawns with Bxc6. The Sicilian Defence is classified under the codes B20 through B99. White may decline the gambit with 3. nc3, called the \"Toilet Variation\", so named after its reputed place of invention.",
    "D48": "The Semi-Slav Defense is a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined chess opening. It is defined by the position reached after the moves:1. d4 d52. c4 c63. Nf3 Nf64. Nc3 e6. After the move order 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Black has the opportunity to respond with 3...e6 instead of 3...Nf6. This \"triangle setup\" opens up some new alternatives for both players on the fourth move. The Meran Variation is one of the main variations of the Semi-Slav. White plays 6.Bd3, provoking the continuation 6...dxc4 7.Bxc4 b5. The line was first played in 1906 in the game Schlechter\u2013Perlis. The variation takes its name from the town of Meran in northern Italy. 8...Bb7 was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 12.Nxc5 Nxc5 13.dxc5 Bxc5 14.Bb5+ and the black king will be stuck in the center. But after 14...Ke7 Black is completely fine and might be even better, with a very strong knight on d5 and strong bishops aiming at the White kingside. Black keeps his c-pawn on c5 is: 11...Qc7 12.dxe6 fxe6 13.Ng5 Qc6 after which there are many different ways to continue for both sides. White's strategic idea in the Meran is to push e3\u2013e4, and with a bishop on d6 Black is always ready to meet this with e6\u2013e5, and typically Black is doing fine after such moves. Most often White players choose the move 7.Bd3. Karpov first played 7.Be2 but it soon transpired that the d3-square gives White better chances. Play often continues 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.h3 with some slight advantage for White. If Black simply takes the pawn with 7...Nxg4, White will respond with 8.Rg1. Black now has a number of playable continuations, including Qf6, Nxh2, f5, h5 and Nh6. The Moscow Variation 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character. Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings. The opening was introduced by Mikhail Botvinnink in 1945. The game typically continues 6...dxc4 7.e4 (note: 7.a4 to prevent Black's b5 does not work) The Botvinnik Variation was invented by Klaus Junge, but he was not the first person known to have played it. Black makes the thematic pawn capture 5...dxc4 immediately. White will fianchetto his king bishop and castle kingside, while Black will play ...c5, ...Qb6, castle queenside. More than 90% of games continue with 5.Bg5 or 5.e3, but there are some sidelines that are worth a quick look. The move 5.Qb3 is an alternative way of protecting the c-pawn. If Black plays 5...dxc4 instead, White will recapture with 6.Qxc4.

The Three Knights Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined is usually reached from the move order 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.Nc3, played to avoid the Nimzo-Indian Defense (from the white point of view) and the Exchange Variation. The Vienna Variation occurs after Black plays 4...dxc4. The Semi-Slav Defense occurs after black plays 4...c6 in the Three Knights Variation.

At the 1927 New York tournament, world champion Jose Raul Capablanca used it as his main weapon against 1.e4. In his 1958 rematch with GM Vassily Smyslov, GM Mikhail Botvinnik became the first player to use it in a match for the world championship. The Caro\u2013Kann has a reputation of being solid but somewhat boring. Black makes very few compromises in pawn structure and plays a timely ...c6\u2013c5 to contest the d4-square.

Black keeps his c-pawn on c5 is: 11...Qc7 12.dxe6 fxe6 13.Ng5 Qc6 after which there are many different ways to continue for both sides. White's strategic idea in the Meran is to push e3\u2013e4, and with a bishop on d6 Black is always ready to meet this with e6\u2013e5, and typically Black is doing fine after such moves. Most often White players choose the move 7.Bd3. Karpov first played 7.Be2 but it soon transpired that the d3-square gives White better chances. Play often continues 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.h3 with some slight advantage for White. If Black simply takes the pawn with 7...Nxg4, White will respond with 8.Rg1. Black now has a number of playable continuations, including Qf6, Nxh2, f5, h5 and Nh6. The Moscow Variation 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character. Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings. The opening was introduced by Mikhail Botvinnink in 1945. The game typically continues 6...dxc4 7.e4 (note: 7.a4 to prevent Black's b5 does not work) The Botvinnik Variation was invented by Klaus Junge, but he was not the first person known to have played it. Black makes the thematic pawn capture 5...dxc4 immediately. White will fianchetto his king bishop and castle kingside, while Black will play ...c5, ...Qb6, castle queenside. More than 90% of games continue with 5.Bg5 or 5.e3, but there are some sidelines that are worth a quick look. The move 5.Qb3 is an alternative way of protecting the c-pawn. If Black plays 5...dxc4 instead, White will recapture with 6.Qxc4.

This \"triangle setup\" opens up some new alternatives for both players on the fourth move. White has the option to enter the Marshall Gambit by playing 4.e4. The Meran is a chess variation first played in 1906 in Schlechter\u2013Perlis. The variation takes its name from the town of Meran (Merano) in northern Italy. White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. Black's main plan, on the other hand, is to find a way to push ...c6\u2013c5. According to some sources, the move was first played in 1923.

Continuing the game with 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 is still very much an option for White. Instead of captures on c5, White can play 12.0-0 with some attacking prospects. The most critical continuation is 12...cxd4, after which White can either play 13.Re1 or 13.Nxd4. White can immediately push 11.e4, and Black must respond with the thematic 11...e5. Play often continues 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.h3 with some slight advantage for White. After 11...h6 12.Nge4 Be7 the position seems very equal, though. The Moscow Variation 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character from the Botvinnik or Anti-Moscow Variations. Black aims to benefit from the slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. The Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced by Mikhail BotVinnik in the 1945 USSR vs. USA radio match vs. Arnold Denker. 11...Bb7 12.Bg2 Qb6 13.exf6 0-0-0 c5 (14...Ne5 is also an option): White can simply capture 15.dxe5, and while Black wins the queen after 15...Rxd1 16.Raxd1, white seems to have the upper hand at least according to engines. 16...Qa6 leads to another wild and forcing continuation: 17.a3 Bxd5 18.Bxd5 Ne5 19.axb4 Rxd5 20.Qe2 cxb4 21.Nc3. After 5.g3, White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with 5...dxc4. After 7.Qb3, the game might continue 7...Nbd7 8.Bg5 Be7 9.e3 with equal opportunities. Black's best reply is considered to be 7...a6 8.e4 c5 and Black is supposed to be fine after either 9.dxc5 or 9. e5.",

The move 8...Bb7 was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 12.Nxc5 Nxc5 13.dxc5 Bxc5 14.Bb5+ and the black king will be stuck in the center. Continuing the game with 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 is still very much an option for White. Instead of captures on c5, White can play 12.0-0 with some attacking prospects. The most critical continuation is 12...cxd4, after which White can either play 13.Re1 or 13.Nxd4. White can immediately push 11.e4, and Black must respond with the thematic 11...e5. Play often continues 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.h3 with some slight advantage for White. After 11...h6 12.Nge4 Be7 the position seems very equal, though. The Moscow Variation 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character from the Botvinnik or Anti-Moscow Variations. Black aims to benefit from the slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. The Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced by Mikhail BotVinnik in the 1945 USSR vs. USA radio match vs. Arnold Denker. 11...Bb7 12.Bg2 Qb6 13.exf6 0-0-0 c5 (14...Ne5 is also an option): White can simply capture 15.dxe5, and while Black wins the queen after 15...Rxd1 16.Raxd1, white seems to have the upper hand at least according to engines. 16...Qa6 leads to another wild and forcing continuation: 17.a3 Bxd5 18.Bxd5 Ne5 19.axb4 Rxd5 20.Qe2 cxb4 21.Nc3. After 5.g3, White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with 5...dxc4. After 7.Qb3, the game might continue 7...Nbd7 8.Bg5 Be7 9.e3 with equal opportunities. Black's best reply is considered to be 7...a6 8.e4 c5 and Black is supposed to be fine after either 9.dxc5 or 9. e5.",
    "D85": "The Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 g63. Nc3 d5. Black offers White the possibility of 4.cxd5, which may be followed by 4...Nxd5 and 5.e4. If White does not take the d5-pawn, Black may eventually play ...dxc4, when a White response of e4 again leads to the same pawn structure. In classical opening theory this imposing pawn centre was held to give White a large advantage, but the hypermodern school of chess held that a large pawn centre could be a liability rather than an asset. White can develop their pieces in a number of ways in the Exchange Variation. For decades, theory held that the correct method of  development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4\u2013f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the exchange with White. The Gr\u00fcnfeld Gambit is not often met in top-flight play today, its usage having declined significantly since its heyday in the 1930s. Despite its reputation, in statistical databases this variation shows only a slightly higher percentage of White wins and draws, as opposed to the Exchange Variation.

The first known game with the gambit is Adler\u2013Mar\u00f3czy (played in Budapest in 1896) It enjoyed a rise in popularity in the early 1920s, but nowadays is rarely played at the top level. The \"Budapest rook\" is a manoeuvre, introduced by the IM Dolfi Drimer in 1968. In most variations Black has the opportunity to play Bb4+, a move whose advisability depends on White's possible answers. White can try to exploit weaknesses with the manoeuvres Bf4\u2013d2\u2013c3 (pressure along the diagonal a1\u2013h8), Ng1\u2013e2\u2013g3\u2013h5 and h2\u2013h4. Budapest Gambit is one of the most famous openings in chess. It involves pawn advances on the queenside, resulting in the creation of a weak pawn for Black, then winning this weak pawn. Alekhine considers 7.Nc3! to be the best system against the Budapest Gambit.

In the diagrammed position, Black most frequently plays 6...Ne7 (The main alternative is 6...Qc7, which can simply transpose to main lines after 7.Qg4 Ne7, but Black also has the option of 7.

Now White can exploit the absence of Black's dark-square bishop by playing 7. qg4, giving Black two choices. 4...b6 followed by ...Ba6, or 4...Qd7 with the idea of meeting 5.Qg4 with 5...f5. Another popular way for Black to deviate is 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Ba5. Black maintains the pin on the knight, which White usually tries to break. The Steinitz Variation is named after Wilhelm Steinitz. The McCutcheon Variation was brought to public attention by John Lindsay McCUTcheon, who used it to defeat Steinitz in a simultaneous exhibition in Manhattan in 1885. After 3...dxe4, Black has the following options:The mainline 4...Nd7 (the most frequent high-level exponent of this variation is Georg Meier) 3...Nc6 is known as the Guimard Variation. 3...Nf6 aims to close the centre. 4...exd5 was a staple of many old Karpov\u2013Korchnoi battles. It usually leads to Black having an isolated queen's pawn (see isolated pawn) The Advance Variation is the most difficult to play against due to the closed structure and unique strategies of the system. The main line is 3...c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 and then we have a branching point:5...Qb6, the idea is to increase the pressure on d4 and eventually undermine the white centre. Despite the symmetrical pawn structure, White cannot force a draw. White will often play c2\u2013c4 at some stage to put pressure on Black's d5-pawn. Black can give White an isolated queen's pawn by capturing on c4, but this gives White's pieces greater freedom. The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence between the cities of London and Paris in 1834.

The Exchange Variation was recommended by Howard Staunton in the 19th century. In the early 1990s, Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3.

There are several types of positions that can arise from the Symmetrical Defence. The Hedgehog system involves a solid but flexible defence in which Black develops by b6, e6, Bb7, and Be7. The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20\u201329 in ECO) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. All irregular responses like 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category. 1...g5 is an eccentric response known as Myers' Defense after Hugh Myers's advocacy of it in print and actual play. It is intended as an improved Grob's Attack; after 2.d4, Black will put pressure on the d4-square with moves such as ...Bg7, ...c5, and ...Qb6. Black obtains no immediate compensation for the sacrificed pawn. The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows as he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess.

In the diagrammed position, Black most frequently plays 6...Ne7 (The main alternative is 6...Qc7, which can simply transpose to main lines after 7.Qg4 Ne7, but Black also has the option of 7. Qg4 f5 or ...f6). Now White can exploit the absence of Black's dark-square bishop by playing 7. qg4, giving Black two choices. 4...b6 followed by ...Ba6, or 4...Qd7 with the idea of meeting 5.Qg4 with 5...f5. Another popular way for Black to deviate is 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Ba5. Black maintains the pin on the knight, which White usually tries to break. The Steinitz Variation is named after Wilhelm Steinitz. The McCutcheon Variation was brought to public attention by John Lindsay McCUTcheon, who used it to defeat Steinitz in a simultaneous exhibition in Manhattan in 1885. After 3...dxe4, Black has the following options:The mainline 4...Nd7 (the most frequent high-level exponent of this variation is Georg Meier) 3...Nc6 is known as the Guimard Variation. 3...Nf6 aims to close the centre. 4...exd5 was a staple of many old Karpov\u2013Korchnoi battles. It usually leads to Black having an isolated queen's pawn (see isolated pawn) The Advance Variation is the most difficult to play against due to the closed structure and unique strategies of the system. The main line is 3...c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 and then we have a branching point:5...Qb6, the idea is to increase the pressure on d4 and eventually undermine the white centre. Despite the symmetrical pawn structure, White cannot force a draw. White will often play c2\u2013c4 at some stage to put pressure on Black's d5-pawn. Black can give White an isolated queen's pawn by capturing on c4, but this gives White's pieces greater freedom. The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence between the cities of London and Paris in 1834. Black usually replies 2...c5, after which play can resemble the 2.d3 variation or the Closed Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Play can continue 2...d5 3. e5 c5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5.c3 Nge7 6.Na3 Nf5. The Exchange Variation was recommended by Howard Staunton in the 19th century. In the early 1990s, Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3. It has the reputation of giving immediate equality to Black due to the symmetrical pawn structure. The Advance declined in popularity, however, throughout most of the 20th century until it was revived in the 1980s.",
    "A33": "The English Opening is a chess opening that begins with the move:1.c4ECOA10\u2013A39. It is one of the four most successful of White's twenty possible first moves. The English derives its name from leading 19th century English master Howard Staunton, who played it during his 1843 match with Saint-Amant. There are several types of positions that can arise from the Symmetrical Defence. The Hedgehog system involves a solid but flexible defence in which Black develops by b6, e6, Bb7, and Be7. The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20\u201329 in ECO) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. All irregular responses like 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category. 1...g5 is an eccentric response known as Myers' Defense after Hugh Myers's advocacy of it in print and actual play. It is intended as an improved Grob's Attack; after 2.d4, Black will put pressure on the d4-square with moves such as ...Bg7, ...c5, and ...Qb6. Black obtains no immediate compensation for the sacrificed pawn. The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows as he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. It is also used in Pawn Sacrifice by Bobby Fischer in the climactic game six of the 1972 World Chess Championship versus Boris Spassky.

Black intends to follow up with 3...Bg7 and 4...d6 (the Gr\u00fcnfeld Defence arises when Black plays 3...d5 instead and is considered a separate opening) 7.0-0 Na6 has seen some popularity recently. The purpose of this move is to transfer the knight to c5 after White's eventual d5, while guarding c7 if Black should play ...Qe8. After 7...a5 White plays 8.Bg5 to pin the knight, making it harder for Black to achieve the ...f7\u2013f5 break. The S\u00e4misch Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3. The game transposes into the Accelerated Dragon variation of the Sicilian Defence. Black has a variety of pawn breaks, such as ...e5, ...c5 and ...b5. 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Be2 0-0 6.Bg5 (named for Yuri Averbakh) The Four Pawns Attack is the most aggressive method for White.

    "A32": "The English Opening is a chess opening that begins with the move:1.c4ECOA10\u2013A39. It is one of the four most successful of White's twenty possible first moves. The English derives its name from leading 19th century English master Howard Staunton, who played it during his 1843 match with Saint-Amant. There are several types of positions that can arise from the Symmetrical Defence. The Hedgehog system involves a solid but flexible defence in which Black develops by b6, e6, Bb7, and Be7. The Reversed Sicilian (classified A20\u201329 in ECO) is another broad category of defence, introduced by the response 1...e5. All irregular responses like 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category. 1...g5 is an eccentric response known as Myers' Defense after Hugh Myers's advocacy of it in print and actual play. It is intended as an improved Grob's Attack; after 2.d4, Black will put pressure on the d4-square with moves such as ...Bg7, ...c5, and ...Qb6. Black obtains no immediate compensation for the sacrificed pawn. The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows as he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. It is also used in Pawn Sacrifice by Bobby Fischer in the climactic game six of the 1972 World Chess Championship versus Boris Spassky.

Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience. In the diagrammed position, Black most frequently plays 6...Ne7 (The main alternative is 6...Qc7, which can simply transpose to main lines after 7.Qg4 Ne7, but Black also has the option of 7. Qg4 f5 or ...f6). Now White can exploit the absence of Black's dark-square bishop by playing 7. qg4, giving Black two choices. 4...b6 followed by ...Ba6, or 4...Qd7 with the idea of meeting 5.Qg4 with 5...f5. Another popular way for Black to deviate is 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Ba5. Black maintains the pin on the knight, which White usually tries to break. The Steinitz Variation is named after Wilhelm Steinitz. The McCutcheon Variation was brought to public attention by John Lindsay McCUTcheon, who used it to defeat Steinitz in a simultaneous exhibition in Manhattan in 1885. After 3...dxe4, Black has the following options:The mainline 4...Nd7 (the most frequent high-level exponent of this variation is Georg Meier) 3...Nc6 is known as the Guimard Variation. 3...Nf6 aims to close the centre. 4...exd5 was a staple of many old Karpov\u2013Korchnoi battles. It usually leads to Black having an isolated queen's pawn (see isolated pawn) The Advance Variation is the most difficult to play against due to the closed structure and unique strategies of the system. The main line is 3...c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 and then we have a branching point:5...Qb6, the idea is to increase the pressure on d4 and eventually undermine the white centre. Despite the symmetrical pawn structure, White cannot force a draw. White will often play c2\u2013c4 at some stage to put pressure on Black's d5-pawn. Black can give White an isolated queen's pawn by capturing on c4, but this gives White's pieces greater freedom. The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence between the cities of London and Paris in 1834. Black usually replies 2...c5, after which play can resemble the 2.d3 variation or the Closed Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Play can continue 2...d5 3. e5 c5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5.c3 Nge7 6.Na3 Nf5. The Exchange Variation was recommended by Howard Staunton in the 19th century. In the early 1990s, Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3.

Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 6.Nf3 Na6) White almost always plays 5.dxc5. The Pirc Variation was not popular during the mid-20th century, because the lines where Black eventually recaptures with theKnight was reckoned to give Black easy equality. 4...Nc6 is the Z\u00fcrich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded.

It is considered an irregular opening, so it is classified under the A00 code in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. The opening is largely based upon tactics on the queenside or the f6- and g7-squares. After 1...a5 White will most likely play 2.b5 and take advantage of Black's queenside weakness. Black's 1...c5 is much sharper and more aggressive and is normally used to avoid theory.

White offers a pawn to divert the black e-pawn. If Black accepts the gambit, White may play d4 and Bxf4. After 2...exf4, the two main continuations for White are 3.Nf3 (King's Knight's Gambit) and 3.Bc4 (Bishop'sGambit) Black's two main approaches are to attempt to hold on to the pawn with ...g5, or to return the pawn in order to facilitate development. With 4.h4 White practically forces 4...g4, thereby undermining any attempt by Black to set up a stable pawn chain. The Quaade Gambit (3.Nf3 g5 4.Nc3) is named after a Danish amateur who discussed it in correspondence with the Deutsche Schachzeitung in the 1880s. The move has received renewed attention following its recommendation by John Shaw in his 2013 book on the King's Gambit. The Fischer Defense (3.Nf3 d6), although previously known, was advocated by Bobby Fischer after he was defeated by Boris Spassky in a Kieseritzky Gambit at the 1960 Mar del Plata tournament. Fischer's analysis of 3...d6, which he called \"a high-class waiting move\", was published in the American Chess Quarterly in 1960. Black's other main option is 3...d5, returning the pawn immediately. John Shaw wrote that 3...Nc6 is a \"refutation\" of the Bishop's Gambit. The Falkbeer Countergambit is named after the 19th-century Austrian master Ernst Falkbeer. 2...Nc6, advocated by Tony Miles; 2...d6, which is the way the King\u2019s Gambit was declined the first known time it was played.

    "E16": "The opening is a solid defense to the Queen's Pawn Game. Black attempts to control the center with pieces in hypermodern style, instead of occupying it with pawns in classical style. The Queen's Indian is regarded as the sister opening of the Nimzo-Indian, since both openings aim to impede White's efforts to gain full control of the center. The classical main line of the Queen's Indian, the most frequently played line from the 1950s until 4...Ba6 became popular in the 1980s, usually continues. White has tried various deviations from the main line in an attempt to unbalance the play. These include:8. Bd2, which defends the knight on c3 and threatens a d4\u2013d5 push.

Another popular way for Black to deviate is 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Ba5. Black maintains the pin on the knight, which White usually tries to break. The Steinitz Variation is named after Wilhelm Steinitz.

It usually leads to Black having an isolated queen's pawn (see isolated pawn) The Advance Variation is the most difficult to play against due to the closed structure and unique strategies of the system. The main line is 3...c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 and then we have a branching point:5...Qb6, the idea is to increase the pressure on d4 and eventually undermine the white centre. Despite the symmetrical pawn structure, White cannot force a draw. White will often play c2\u2013c4 at some stage to put pressure on Black's d5-pawn. Black can give White an isolated queen's pawn by capturing on c4, but this gives White's pieces greater freedom.

    "D00": "The Blackmar\u2013Diemer Gambit is a chess opening characterized by the moves:1. d4 d52. e4 dxe43. Nc3. White obtains a tempo and a half-open f-file in return for a pawn. It is considered an aggressive opening, but its soundness continues to be the subject of much debate. The Blackmar\u2013Diemer Gambit is one of the most popular moves in chess. Black can decline the gambit on the second move with 2...e6 or 2...c6. The main response for White is 6.Ne5, intending to attack the black bishop with an advance of the kingside pawns. The line 5...Bf5 was extensively analysed by Gerhart Gunderam. The 5...e6 line aims to reach a French Defence type position, but with Black having an extra pawn. Black can retreat the bishop with 6...Bh5 7.g4 Bg6 8.Ne5, a line which often transposes to the Gunderam Defence line 5...Bf5. The Bogoljubov Defence was played by Diemer himself in a game against BogolJubov. The Blackmar\u2013Diemer Gambit still isn't viable beyond club-level or rapid-play games. White has serious problems proving enough compensation for the sacrificed pawns after 5... Qxd4 6. Be3 Qg4 7.Qf2 e5. Black can also decline the pawn with 5...c6 or 5...e6. The Vienna Defence was recommended by Matthias Wahls in his book Modernes Skandinavisch. It is a refutation of the Blackmar\u2013Diemer Gambit. White can play for compensation for a pawn with 5.fxe4 Nxe4 6.Qf3. The main line runs 6...Nd6 7.Bf4 e6 8-0-0 c6 9.g4 Bg6 10.Qe3 Be7. The Lemberger Counter-Gambit is an important alternative. Black can sidestep the Blackmar\u2013Diemer Gambit in several ways.

In the Two Knights Variation, White immediately accepts doubled pawns after 3...Nxc3 for some compensation. After 4.dxc3 this compensation is rapid piece development. The statistics presented by Cox show this variation scoring poorly for White, with all of Black's main defences scoring at least 50%. 2.Nc3 is by far White's most common alternative to 2.e5. The independent Alekhine line is 2...d5, known as the Scandinavian Variation. White gets a large advantage with 3.d4 f6 (or 3...e6 4.Nh3 h6) 2.Bc4, the Krejczik Variation, is rarely seen, since it allows Black to gain the bishop pair and seize space in the centre.

    "D45": "The Semi-Slav Defense is a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined chess opening. It is defined by the position reached after the moves:1. d4 d52. c4 c63. Nf3 Nf64. Nc3 e6. After the move order 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Black has the opportunity to respond with 3...e6 instead of 3...Nf6. This \"triangle setup\" opens up some new alternatives for both players on the fourth move. White has the option to enter the Marshall Gambit by playing 4.e4. The Meran is a chess variation first played in 1906 in Schlechter\u2013Perlis. The variation takes its name from the town of Meran (Merano) in northern Italy. White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. Black's main plan, on the other hand, is to find a way to push ...c6\u2013c5. According to some sources, the move was first played in 1923. The move 8...Bb7 was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 12.Nxc5 Nxc5 13.dxc5 Bxc5 14.Bb5+ and the black king will be stuck in the center. Continuing the game with 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 is still very much an option for White. Instead of captures on c5, White can play 12.0-0 with some attacking prospects. The most critical continuation is 12...cxd4, after which White can either play 13.Re1 or 13.Nxd4. White can immediately push 11.e4, and Black must respond with the thematic 11...e5. Play often continues 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.h3 with some slight advantage for White. After 11...h6 12.Nge4 Be7 the position seems very equal, though. The Moscow Variation 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character from the Botvinnik or Anti-Moscow Variations. Black aims to benefit from the slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. The Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced by Mikhail BotVinnik in the 1945 USSR vs. USA radio match vs. Arnold Denker. 11...Bb7 12.Bg2 Qb6 13.exf6 0-0-0 c5 (14...Ne5 is also an option): White can simply capture 15.dxe5, and while Black wins the queen after 15...Rxd1 16.Raxd1, white seems to have the upper hand at least according to engines. 16...Qa6 leads to another wild and forcing continuation: 17.a3 Bxd5 18.Bxd5 Ne5 19.axb4 Rxd5 20.Qe2 cxb4 21.Nc3.

After the move order 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Black has the opportunity to respond with 3...e6 instead of 3...Nf6. This \"triangle setup\" opens up some new alternatives for both players on the fourth move. White has the option to enter the Marshall Gambit by playing 4.e4. The Meran is a chess variation first played in 1906 in Schlechter\u2013Perlis. The variation takes its name from the town of Meran (Merano) in northern Italy. White will play in the center, leading to a rich, complicated game. Black's main plan, on the other hand, is to find a way to push ...c6\u2013c5. According to some sources, the move was first played in 1923. The move 8...Bb7 was long considered virtually unplayable due to the line 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 12.Nxc5 Nxc5 13.dxc5 Bxc5 14.Bb5+ and the black king will be stuck in the center. Continuing the game with 9.e4 b4 10.Na4 c5 11.e5 Nd5 is still very much an option for White. Instead of captures on c5, White can play 12.0-0 with some attacking prospects. The most critical continuation is 12...cxd4, after which White can either play 13.Re1 or 13.Nxd4. White can immediately push 11.e4, and Black must respond with the thematic 11...e5. Play often continues 12.dxe5 Nxe5 13.Nxe5 Bxe5 14.h3 with some slight advantage for White. After 11...h6 12.Nge4 Be7 the position seems very equal, though. The Moscow Variation 5...h6 6.Bxf6 Qxf6 gives rise to play of a very different character from the Botvinnik or Anti-Moscow Variations. Black aims to benefit from the slight dark square weaknesses left behind on the queenside after the bishop has moved outside the pawn chain. The Botvinnik Variation is probably one of the most complicated of all chess openings, with theory stretching past move thirty in some variations. The opening was introduced by Mikhail BotVinnik in the 1945 USSR vs. USA radio match vs. Arnold Denker. 11...Bb7 12.Bg2 Qb6 13.exf6 0-0-0 c5 (14...Ne5 is also an option): White can simply capture 15.dxe5, and while Black wins the queen after 15...Rxd1 16.Raxd1, white seems to have the upper hand at least according to engines. 16...Qa6 leads to another wild and forcing continuation: 17.a3 Bxd5 18.Bxd5 Ne5 19.axb4 Rxd5 20.Qe2 cxb4 21.Nc3. After 5.g3, White makes a claim that he's ready to play the Catalan, with the black pawn a bit passively on c6. This practically forces Black to take the c-pawn with 5...dxc4. After 7.Qb3, the game might continue 7...Nbd7 8.Bg5 Be7 9.e3 with equal opportunities.

The move has received renewed attention following its recommendation by John Shaw in his 2013 book on the King's Gambit. The Fischer Defense (3.Nf3 d6), although previously known, was advocated by Bobby Fischer after he was defeated by Boris Spassky in a Kieseritzky Gambit at the 1960 Mar del Plata tournament. Fischer's analysis of 3...d6, which he called \"a high-class waiting move\", was published in the American Chess Quarterly in 1960. Black's other main option is 3...d5, returning the pawn immediately. John Shaw wrote that 3...Nc6 is a \"refutation\" of the Bishop's Gambit.

    "A01": "The Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack is a chess opening typically starting with the move: 1.b3 but sometimes introduced by the move order 1.Nf3 and then 2.b 3. The flank opening move 1. b3 prepares to fianchetto the queen's bishop where it will help control the central squares in hypermodern fashion. The earliest master-level exponent of the opening was the strong English amateur John Owen in the 1870s. 1.b3 e5 2.Bb2 Nc6 3.c4 Nf6 4.e3 d5 5.cxd5 Nxd5 is likely to resemble a quiet Hedgehog-type line from the Paulsen Sicilian. The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a popular defence to 1.d4 with colours reversed and an extra tempo. The 1.b3 move order has the added advantage that in most lines White has a greater range of options available because f4 is still playable. This is particularly relevant when compared to lines such as 1.Nf3 d6 or 1.Bb2 Nc6 where Black is able to play 2...e5. Jacobs & Tait also note that a 1.nf3move order allows Black to play 1...g6, preventing White from following up with 2. b3. Chess is a popular game of chess.

    "A06": "The Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack is a chess opening typically starting with the move: 1.b3 but sometimes introduced by the move order 1.Nf3 and then 2.b 3. The flank opening move 1. b3 prepares to fianchetto the queen's bishop where it will help control the central squares in hypermodern fashion. The earliest master-level exponent of the opening was the strong English amateur John Owen in the 1870s. 1.b3 e5 2.Bb2 Nc6 3.c4 Nf6 4.e3 d5 5.cxd5 Nxd5 is likely to resemble a quiet Hedgehog-type line from the Paulsen Sicilian. The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a popular defence to 1.d4 with colours reversed and an extra tempo. The 1.b3 move order has the added advantage that in most lines White has a greater range of options available because f4 is still playable. This is particularly relevant when compared to lines such as 1.Nf3 d6 or 1.Bb2 Nc6 where Black is able to play 2...e5. Jacobs & Tait also note that a 1.nf3move order allows Black to play 1...g6, preventing White from following up with 2. b3. Chess is a popular game of chess.

With 4.h4 White practically forces 4...g4, thereby undermining any attempt by Black to set up a stable pawn chain. The Quaade Gambit (3.Nf3 g5 4.Nc3) is named after a Danish amateur who discussed it in correspondence with the Deutsche Schachzeitung in the 1880s. The move has received renewed attention following its recommendation by John Shaw in his 2013 book on the King's Gambit. The Fischer Defense (3.Nf3 d6), although previously known, was advocated by Bobby Fischer after he was defeated by Boris Spassky in a Kieseritzky Gambit at the 1960 Mar del Plata tournament. Fischer's analysis of 3...d6, which he called \"a high-class waiting move\", was published in the American Chess Quarterly in 1960. Black's other main option is 3...d5, returning the pawn immediately. John Shaw wrote that 3...Nc6 is a \"refutation\" of the Bishop's Gambit.

Fischer's analysis of 3...d6, which he called \"a high-class waiting move\", was published in the American Chess Quarterly in 1960. Black's other main option is 3...d5, returning the pawn immediately. John Shaw wrote that 3...Nc6 is a \"refutation\" of the Bishop's Gambit. The Falkbeer Countergambit is named after the 19th-century Austrian master Ernst Falkbeer. 2...Nc6, advocated by Tony Miles; 2...d6, which is the way the King\u2019s Gambit was declined the first known time it was played. The greedy 2...Qf6 (known as the Nordwalde Variation), intending 3...Qxf4, is considered dubious. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings has ten codes for the King's Gambit, C30 through C39.",

    "C18": "The French Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves 1.e4 e6 and 2.d4 d5. Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience. In the diagrammed position, Black most frequently plays 6...Ne7 (The main alternative is 6...Qc7, which can simply transpose to main lines after 7.Qg4 Ne7, but Black also has the option of 7. Qg4 f5 or ...f6). Now White can exploit the absence of Black's dark-square bishop by playing 7. qg4, giving Black two choices. 4...b6 followed by ...Ba6, or 4...Qd7 with the idea of meeting 5.Qg4 with 5...f5. Another popular way for Black to deviate is 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Ba5. Black maintains the pin on the knight, which White usually tries to break. The Steinitz Variation is named after Wilhelm Steinitz. The McCutcheon Variation was brought to public attention by John Lindsay McCUTcheon, who used it to defeat Steinitz in a simultaneous exhibition in Manhattan in 1885. After 3...dxe4, Black has the following options:The mainline 4...Nd7 (the most frequent high-level exponent of this variation is Georg Meier) 3...Nc6 is known as the Guimard Variation. 3...Nf6 aims to close the centre. 4...exd5 was a staple of many old Karpov\u2013Korchnoi battles. It usually leads to Black having an isolated queen's pawn (see isolated pawn) The Advance Variation is the most difficult to play against due to the closed structure and unique strategies of the system. The main line is 3...c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 and then we have a branching point:5...Qb6, the idea is to increase the pressure on d4 and eventually undermine the white centre. Despite the symmetrical pawn structure, White cannot force a draw. White will often play c2\u2013c4 at some stage to put pressure on Black's d5-pawn. Black can give White an isolated queen's pawn by capturing on c4, but this gives White's pieces greater freedom. The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence between the cities of London and Paris in 1834.

The Exchange Variation was recommended by Howard Staunton in the 19th century. In the early 1990s, Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3.

All irregular responses like 1...b6 and 1...g5 are also lumped into this third broad category. 1...g5 is an eccentric response known as Myers' Defense after Hugh Myers's advocacy of it in print and actual play. It is intended as an improved Grob's Attack; after 2.d4, Black will put pressure on the d4-square with moves such as ...Bg7, ...c5, and ...Qb6. Black obtains no immediate compensation for the sacrificed pawn. The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows as he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess.

Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience. In the diagrammed position, Black most frequently plays 6...Ne7 (The main alternative is 6...Qc7, which can simply transpose to main lines after 7.Qg4 Ne7, but Black also has the option of 7. Qg4 f5 or ...f6). Now White can exploit the absence of Black's dark-square bishop by playing 7. qg4, giving Black two choices. 4...b6 followed by ...Ba6, or 4...Qd7 with the idea of meeting 5.Qg4 with 5...f5. Another popular way for Black to deviate is 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Ba5. Black maintains the pin on the knight, which White usually tries to break. The Steinitz Variation is named after Wilhelm Steinitz. The McCutcheon Variation was brought to public attention by John Lindsay McCUTcheon, who used it to defeat Steinitz in a simultaneous exhibition in Manhattan in 1885. After 3...dxe4, Black has the following options:The mainline 4...Nd7 (the most frequent high-level exponent of this variation is Georg Meier) 3...Nc6 is known as the Guimard Variation. 3...Nf6 aims to close the centre. 4...exd5 was a staple of many old Karpov\u2013Korchnoi battles. It usually leads to Black having an isolated queen's pawn (see isolated pawn) The Advance Variation is the most difficult to play against due to the closed structure and unique strategies of the system. The main line is 3...c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 and then we have a branching point:5...Qb6, the idea is to increase the pressure on d4 and eventually undermine the white centre. Despite the symmetrical pawn structure, White cannot force a draw. White will often play c2\u2013c4 at some stage to put pressure on Black's d5-pawn. Black can give White an isolated queen's pawn by capturing on c4, but this gives White's pieces greater freedom. The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence between the cities of London and Paris in 1834. Black usually replies 2...c5, after which play can resemble the 2.d3 variation or the Closed Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Play can continue 2...d5 3. e5 c5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5.c3 Nge7 6.Na3 Nf5. The Exchange Variation was recommended by Howard Staunton in the 19th century. In the early 1990s, Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3.

    "C11": "The French Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves 1.e4 e6 and 2.d4 d5. Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience. In the diagrammed position, Black most frequently plays 6...Ne7 (The main alternative is 6...Qc7, which can simply transpose to main lines after 7.Qg4 Ne7, but Black also has the option of 7. Qg4 f5 or ...f6). Now White can exploit the absence of Black's dark-square bishop by playing 7. qg4, giving Black two choices. 4...b6 followed by ...Ba6, or 4...Qd7 with the idea of meeting 5.Qg4 with 5...f5. Another popular way for Black to deviate is 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Ba5. Black maintains the pin on the knight, which White usually tries to break. The Steinitz Variation is named after Wilhelm Steinitz. The McCutcheon Variation was brought to public attention by John Lindsay McCUTcheon, who used it to defeat Steinitz in a simultaneous exhibition in Manhattan in 1885. After 3...dxe4, Black has the following options:The mainline 4...Nd7 (the most frequent high-level exponent of this variation is Georg Meier) 3...Nc6 is known as the Guimard Variation. 3...Nf6 aims to close the centre. 4...exd5 was a staple of many old Karpov\u2013Korchnoi battles. It usually leads to Black having an isolated queen's pawn (see isolated pawn) The Advance Variation is the most difficult to play against due to the closed structure and unique strategies of the system. The main line is 3...c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 and then we have a branching point:5...Qb6, the idea is to increase the pressure on d4 and eventually undermine the white centre. Despite the symmetrical pawn structure, White cannot force a draw. White will often play c2\u2013c4 at some stage to put pressure on Black's d5-pawn. Black can give White an isolated queen's pawn by capturing on c4, but this gives White's pieces greater freedom. The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence between the cities of London and Paris in 1834. Black usually replies 2...c5, after which play can resemble the 2.d3 variation or the Closed Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Play can continue 2...d5 3. e5 c5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5.c3 Nge7 6.Na3 Nf5. The Exchange Variation was recommended by Howard Staunton in the 19th century. In the early 1990s, Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3. It has the reputation of giving immediate equality to Black due to the symmetrical pawn structure. The Advance declined in popularity, however, throughout most of the 20th century until it was revived in the 1980s.",

For decades, theory held that the correct method of  development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4\u2013f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the exchange with White. The Gr\u00fcnfeld Gambit is not often met in top-flight play today, its usage having declined significantly since its heyday in the 1930s.

If White does not take the d5-pawn, Black may eventually play ...dxc4, when a White response of e4 again leads to the same pawn structure. In classical opening theory this imposing pawn centre was held to give White a large advantage, but the hypermodern school of chess held that a large pawn centre could be a liability rather than an asset. White can develop their pieces in a number of ways in the Exchange Variation. For decades, theory held that the correct method of  development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4\u2013f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the exchange with White. The Gr\u00fcnfeld Gambit is not often met in top-flight play today, its usage having declined significantly since its heyday in the 1930s. Despite its reputation, in statistical databases this variation shows only a slightly higher percentage of White wins and draws, as opposed to the Exchange Variation.

The other bishop is developed to d3 (or occasionally e2) and the knights typically to f3 and d2. The London System can be used against virtually any Black defence and comprises a smaller body of opening theory than many other openings. White will typically post his king's knight on e5 and aim for a kingside attack. Black will typically aim for either ...e5 (after suitable preparation with Nbd7 and Re8) or ...c5 (in which case the game will resemble a R\u00e9ti Opening with colours reversed) Other options for Black include mirroring White's play by also adopting the London System.

If White does not take the d5-pawn, Black may eventually play ...dxc4, when a White response of e4 again leads to the same pawn structure. In classical opening theory this imposing pawn centre was held to give White a large advantage, but the hypermodern school of chess held that a large pawn centre could be a liability rather than an asset. White can develop their pieces in a number of ways in the Exchange Variation. For decades, theory held that the correct method of  development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4\u2013f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the exchange with White. The Gr\u00fcnfeld Gambit is not often met in top-flight play today, its usage having declined significantly since its heyday in the 1930s. Despite its reputation, in statistical databases this variation shows only a slightly higher percentage of White wins and draws, as opposed to the Exchange Variation.

In 1813, the English master Jacob Henry Sarratt effectively standardised his English translation of the name of this opening as 'the Sicilian defence' The Sicilian was fairly popular for much of the nineteenth century; Louis-Charles Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais, Adolf Anderssen, Howard Staunton, Louis Paulsen, and Carl Jaenisch all played it with some consistency. It fell out of favour in the later part of the 19th century, when some of the world's leading players rejected it. Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov popularised it in the 1980s and 1990s. 2.Na3 is an eccentric move recently returned to prominence by GM Vadim Zvjaginsev. Modern players would consider the notion that the Sicilian \"prevents every attack\" naive. The modern main line runs 2.Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7. 2.e5 gains space and prevents Black playing ...Nf6.
