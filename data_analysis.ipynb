It is Black's most dynamic, asymmetrical reply to 1.e4. After 2.Nf3 there are three options for Black: 2...d6, 2...Nc6, and 2...e6. The Najdorf Variation is Black's most popular system in the Sicilian Defence. White's intention with 5...a6 was to prepare ...e5 on the next move to gain space in the centre. The immediate 5...e5?! is met by 6.Bb5+!, when Black must either play 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7. White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterised by 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 0-0 8.Qd2 Nc6. The Classical Variation of the Dragon leads to a less ferocious game. White's pressure on the d6-pawn often compels Black to respond to Bxf6 with ...gxf6. White's third most common move is 6.Be2, (ECO codes B58–B59), after which Black can remain in independent variations with the Boleslavsky Variation 6...e5. The old main line 7.B3 is now less popular than the modern 7.Nf3, after which the game usually continues. The Sveshnikov Variation was popularised in the 1970s and 80s. It is extremely popular among grandmasters and amateurs alike. The main line after 5...e5 runs as follows:6. Ndb5The theoretically critical move, threatening Nd6+. All other moves are considered to allow Black easy equality. The entire variation up to 8...b5 is referred to as the Chelyabinsk Variation. The Kalashnikov Variation is a close relative of the Sveshnikov Variations. Black develops the bishop to g7 in the Accelerated Dragon Variation. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4, the Maróczy Bind. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov–Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986. Black's move 2...e6 gives priority to developing the dark-squared bishop. After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 ( the Kan Variation) and 4 ...Nf6. White's second most popular reply is 5.Nc3, when Black's development of the kingside knight often takes focus. Black normally plays a move to control the e5-square and prevent the pawn from advancing. The Four Knights Variation is mainly used as a way to get into the main line Sveshnikov Variation, reached after 6.Ndb5 d6. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6, White's most important alternative to 3.d4 is 3.Bb5+. Grandmasters sometimes choose this variation when they wish to avoid theory. The most frequent continuation is 3...Nf6 4.Be2, when 4...Nxe4? loses to 5.Qa4+ and likewise 4 ...Nc6 5 d4 Nxe4?: loses to 6 d5 and 7 Qa4+. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3, Black has some less commonly played options apart from 2...d6, 2...Nc6 and 2...e6. White's strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3, when 5...b6?, as Nimzowitsch played and recommended, loses to 6.e6! f6. 2...Nc6 is the most common choice, but 2...e6 and 2...d6 are often played. Black has various replies to 2.Nc3 in the Open Sicilian. The Alapin Variation or c3 Sicilian is popular. Players usually enter the Grand Prix Attack by playing 2Nc4 before 3f3. 2.d3 signals White's intention to develop along King's Indian Attack lines, and usually transposes to the Closed Sicilian. White often supports the e5-pawn with 3.f4 or 3.Nf3. The drawback of 2.e5 is that no additional pressure is brought to the centre. The Sicilian Defence has more codes than any other opening. The Wing Gambit is generally considered too reckless, and rarely seen in grandmaster praxis.

The Najdorf Variation is Black's most popular system in the Sicilian Defence. White's intention with 5...a6 was to prepare ...e5 on the next move to gain space in the centre. The immediate 5...e5?! is met by 6.Bb5+!, when Black must either play 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7. White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterised by 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 0-0 8.Qd2 Nc6. The Classical Variation of the Dragon leads to a less ferocious game. White's pressure on the d6-pawn often compels Black to respond to Bxf6 with ...gxf6. White's third most common move is 6.Be2, (ECO codes B58–B59), after which Black can remain in independent variations with the Boleslavsky Variation 6...e5. The old main line 7.B3 is now less popular than the modern 7.Nf3, after which the game usually continues. The Sveshnikov Variation was popularised in the 1970s and 80s. It is extremely popular among grandmasters and amateurs alike. The main line after 5...e5 runs as follows:6. Ndb5The theoretically critical move, threatening Nd6+. All other moves are considered to allow Black easy equality. The entire variation up to 8...b5 is referred to as the Chelyabinsk Variation. The Kalashnikov Variation is a close relative of the Sveshnikov Variations. Black develops the bishop to g7 in the Accelerated Dragon Variation. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4, the Maróczy Bind. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov–Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986. Black's move 2...e6 gives priority to developing the dark-squared bishop. After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 ( the Kan Variation) and 4 ...Nf6. White's second most popular reply is 5.Nc3, when Black's development of the kingside knight often takes focus. Black normally plays a move to control the e5-square and prevent the pawn from advancing. The Four Knights Variation is mainly used as a way to get into the main line Sveshnikov Variation, reached after 6.Ndb5 d6. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6, White's most important alternative to 3.d4 is 3.Bb5+. Grandmasters sometimes choose this variation when they wish to avoid theory. The most frequent continuation is 3...Nf6 4.Be2, when 4...Nxe4? loses to 5.Qa4+ and likewise 4 ...Nc6 5 d4 Nxe4?: loses to 6 d5 and 7 Qa4+. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3, Black has some less commonly played options apart from 2...d6, 2...Nc6 and 2...e6. White's strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3, when 5...b6?, as Nimzowitsch played and recommended, loses to 6.e6! f6. 2...Nc6 is the most common choice, but 2...e6 and 2...d6 are often played. Black has various replies to 2.Nc3 in the Open Sicilian. The Alapin Variation or c3 Sicilian is popular. Players usually enter the Grand Prix Attack by playing 2Nc4 before 3f3. 2.d3 signals White's intention to develop along King's Indian Attack lines, and usually transposes to the Closed Sicilian. White often supports the e5-pawn with 3.f4 or 3.Nf3. The drawback of 2.e5 is that no additional pressure is brought to the centre. The Sicilian Defence has more codes than any other opening. The Wing Gambit is generally considered too reckless, and rarely seen in grandmaster praxis.

      "\"The Sicilian Defence is a chess opening that begins with the following moves:1.e4 c5ECOB20–B99OriginGiulio Cesare Polerio, 1594Named afterSicilyParentKing's Pawn Game. The Sicilian Defence was popular for much of the nineteenth century. It fell out of favour when some of the world's leading players rejected it. The Sicilian was not seen even in the 75 games played at the St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. It was played six times (out of 110 games) at New York 1924. Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov are two of the most famous players to have played the Sicilian Defence. The Sicilian is the most played and most analysed opening at both the club and master levels. It is Black's most dynamic, asymmetrical reply to 1.e4. After 2.Nf3 there are three options for Black: 2...d6, 2...Nc6, and 2...e6. The Najdorf Variation is Black's most popular system in the Sicilian Defence. White's intention with 5...a6 was to prepare ...e5 on the next move to gain space in the centre. The immediate 5...e5?! is met by 6.Bb5+!, when Black must either play 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7. White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterised by 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 0-0 8.Qd2 Nc6. The Classical Variation of the Dragon leads to a less ferocious game. White's pressure on the d6-pawn often compels Black to respond to Bxf6 with ...gxf6. White's third most common move is 6.Be2, (ECO codes B58–B59), after which Black can remain in independent variations with the Boleslavsky Variation 6...e5. The old main line 7.B3 is now less popular than the modern 7.Nf3, after which the game usually continues. The Sveshnikov Variation was popularised in the 1970s and 80s. It is extremely popular among grandmasters and amateurs alike. The main line after 5...e5 runs as follows:6. Ndb5The theoretically critical move, threatening Nd6+. All other moves are considered to allow Black easy equality. The entire variation up to 8...b5 is referred to as the Chelyabinsk Variation. The Kalashnikov Variation is a close relative of the Sveshnikov Variations. Black develops the bishop to g7 in the Accelerated Dragon Variation. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4, the Maróczy Bind. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov–Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986. Black's move 2...e6 gives priority to developing the dark-squared bishop. After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 ( the Kan Variation) and 4 ...Nf6. White's second most popular reply is 5.Nc3, when Black's development of the kingside knight often takes focus. Black normally plays a move to control the e5-square and prevent the pawn from advancing. The Four Knights Variation is mainly used as a way to get into the main line Sveshnikov Variation, reached after 6.Ndb5 d6. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6, White's most important alternative to 3.d4 is 3.Bb5+. Grandmasters sometimes choose this variation when they wish to avoid theory. The most frequent continuation is 3...Nf6 4.Be2, when 4...Nxe4? loses to 5.Qa4+ and likewise 4 ...Nc6 5 d4 Nxe4?: loses to 6 d5 and 7 Qa4+. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3, Black has some less commonly played options apart from 2...d6, 2...Nc6 and 2...e6. White's strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3, when 5...b6?, as Nimzowitsch played and recommended, loses to 6.e6! f6. 2...Nc6 is the most common choice, but 2...e6 and 2...d6 are often played. Black has various replies to 2.Nc3 in the Open Sicilian. The Alapin Variation or c3 Sicilian is popular. Players usually enter the Grand Prix Attack by playing 2Nc4 before 3f3. 2.d3 signals White's intention to develop along King's Indian Attack lines, and usually transposes to the Closed Sicilian. White often supports the e5-pawn with 3.f4 or 3.Nf3. The drawback of 2.e5 is that no additional pressure is brought to the centre. The Sicilian Defence has more codes than any other opening.

      "\"The Sicilian Defence is a chess opening that begins with the following moves:1.e4 c5ECOB20–B99OriginGiulio Cesare Polerio, 1594Named afterSicilyParentKing's Pawn Game. The Sicilian Defence was popular for much of the nineteenth century. It fell out of favour when some of the world's leading players rejected it. The Sicilian was not seen even in the 75 games played at the St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. It was played six times (out of 110 games) at New York 1924. Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov are two of the most famous players to have played the Sicilian Defence. The Sicilian is the most played and most analysed opening at both the club and master levels. It is Black's most dynamic, asymmetrical reply to 1.e4. After 2.Nf3 there are three options for Black: 2...d6, 2...Nc6, and 2...e6. The Najdorf Variation is Black's most popular system in the Sicilian Defence. White's intention with 5...a6 was to prepare ...e5 on the next move to gain space in the centre. The immediate 5...e5?! is met by 6.Bb5+!, when Black must either play 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7. White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterised by 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 0-0 8.Qd2 Nc6. The Classical Variation of the Dragon leads to a less ferocious game. White's pressure on the d6-pawn often compels Black to respond to Bxf6 with ...gxf6. White's third most common move is 6.Be2, (ECO codes B58–B59), after which Black can remain in independent variations with the Boleslavsky Variation 6...e5. The old main line 7.B3 is now less popular than the modern 7.Nf3, after which the game usually continues. The Sveshnikov Variation was popularised in the 1970s and 80s. It is extremely popular among grandmasters and amateurs alike. The main line after 5...e5 runs as follows:6. Ndb5The theoretically critical move, threatening Nd6+. All other moves are considered to allow Black easy equality. The entire variation up to 8...b5 is referred to as the Chelyabinsk Variation. The Kalashnikov Variation is a close relative of the Sveshnikov Variations. Black develops the bishop to g7 in the Accelerated Dragon Variation. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4, the Maróczy Bind. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov–Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986. Black's move 2...e6 gives priority to developing the dark-squared bishop. After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 ( the Kan Variation) and 4 ...Nf6. White's second most popular reply is 5.Nc3, when Black's development of the kingside knight often takes focus. Black normally plays a move to control the e5-square and prevent the pawn from advancing. The Four Knights Variation is mainly used as a way to get into the main line Sveshnikov Variation, reached after 6.Ndb5 d6. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6, White's most important alternative to 3.d4 is 3.Bb5+. Grandmasters sometimes choose this variation when they wish to avoid theory. The most frequent continuation is 3...Nf6 4.Be2, when 4...Nxe4? loses to 5.Qa4+ and likewise 4 ...Nc6 5 d4 Nxe4?: loses to 6 d5 and 7 Qa4+. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3, Black has some less commonly played options apart from 2...d6, 2...Nc6 and 2...e6. White's strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3, when 5...b6?, as Nimzowitsch played and recommended, loses to 6.e6! f6. 2...Nc6 is the most common choice, but 2...e6 and 2...d6 are often played. Black has various replies to 2.Nc3 in the Open Sicilian. The Alapin Variation or c3 Sicilian is popular. Players usually enter the Grand Prix Attack by playing 2Nc4 before 3f3. 2.d3 signals White's intention to develop along King's Indian Attack lines, and usually transposes to the Closed Sicilian. White often supports the e5-pawn with 3.f4 or 3.Nf3. The drawback of 2.e5 is that no additional pressure is brought to the centre. The Sicilian Defence has more codes than any other opening. The Wing Gambit is generally considered too reckless, and rarely seen in grandmaster praxis.

      "\"The Sicilian Defence is a chess opening that begins with the following moves:1.e4 c5ECOB20–B99OriginGiulio Cesare Polerio, 1594Named afterSicilyParentKing's Pawn Game.Pros: A solid beginning but still an unbalanced gameUnlike many Sicilians, Black develops relatively quickly. The Sicilian Defence was analysed by Giulio Polerio in his 1594 manuscript on chess. It was later the subject of analyses by leading players of the day Alessandro Salvio (1604), Don Pietro Carrera (c. 1617), and Gioachino Greco (1623) The Sicilian was fairly popular for much of the nineteenth century. It fell out of favour when some of the world's leading players rejected it in favour of 1...e5. The Sicilian Defence is one of the most popular openings in chess. It is used by world champions Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov. Most grandmasters include the Sicilian in their opening repertoire. Black's most common move after 2.Nf3 is ...Nf6, followed by 2...e6. The Najdorf Variation is Black's most popular system in the Sicilian Defence. The immediate 5...e5?! is met by 6.Bb5+!, when Black must either play 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7. White's idea is to play f3, Qd2, 0-0-0 and g4 in some order. Formerly, 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 was the main line of the Najdorf, when White threatens to attack the pinned knight with 8.e5. Black can simply break the pin with 7...Be7. White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterised by 6.Be3 Bg7 7f3 0-0 8.Qd2 Nc6. White's third most common move is 6.Be2, after which Black can remain in independent variations with the Boleslavsky Variation 6...e5. White can either castle kingside with 7.Bb3 a6 8.0-0 (the Fischer–Sozin Attack, named after Bobby Fischer and Russian master Veniamin Sozin, who originated it in the 1930s) Black can also try Benko's move 6...Qb6, which forces White to make a decision over the d4-knight. Other important moves are 4...e6 (transposing to the Taimanov Variation), 4...g6 (the Kalashnikov Variation) and 4...E5. The Sveshnikov Variation was pioneered by Evgeny SvesHnikov and Gennadi Timoshchenko in the 1970s. Emanuel Lasker played it once in his world championship match against Carl Schlechter, and Jorge Pelikan played it a few times in the 1950s. The move 5...e5 seems anti-positional as it leaves Black with a backwards d-pawn and a weakness on d5. Today, it is extremely popular among grandmasters and amateurs. In the diagrammed position after 8...b5, White usually parries the threat of ...b4 by playing 9.Bxf6 or 9.Nd5. White's powerful knight on d5 and Black's shattered kingside pawn structure are compensated by Black's bishop pair and White's offside knight on a3. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov–Van der Wiel, Brussels 1986. Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 ( the Kan Variation) and 4 ...Nf6. Kan Variation: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 a6 named after Ilya Kan. Four Knights Variation is mainly used as a way to get into the main line Sveshnikov Variation. White can play 2.Nf3 without intending to follow up with 3.d4. Black sometimes plays 3...e5 to avoid both moves; then 4...Bc4 is considered White's best move. The systems given below are usually classified along with White's second move alternatives as Anti-Sicilians. White's usual intention is to play Bxc6, giving Black doubled pawns. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3, Black has some less commonly played options apart from 2...d6, 2...Nc6 and 2...e6. White's strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3. 2...Nc6 is the most common choice, but 2...e6 and 2...d6 are often played. Main line of the Closed Sicilian is 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.d3 d6 (diagram) Black's best reply is 2...exd5 3.5! Nf6!, the Talbit Gambit, which has caused 2f4 to decline in popularity. 2...e6 is a less common option, as La Bourdonnais played against McDonnell. The modern main line runs 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7. White can play the positional 5.Bb5, threatening to double Black's pawns.

      "\"The Sicilian Defence is a chess opening that begins with the following moves:1.e4 c5ECOB20–B99OriginGiulio Cesare Polerio, 1594Named afterSicilyParentKing's Pawn Game. The Sicilian Defence was popular for much of the nineteenth century. It fell out of favour when some of the world's leading players rejected it. The Sicilian was not seen even in the 75 games played at the St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. It was played six times (out of 110 games) at New York 1924. Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov are two of the most famous players to have played the Sicilian Defence. The Sicilian is the most played and most analysed opening at both the club and master levels. It is Black's most dynamic, asymmetrical reply to 1.e4. After 2.Nf3 there are three options for Black: 2...d6, 2...Nc6, and 2...e6. The Najdorf Variation is Black's most popular system in the Sicilian Defence. White's intention with 5...a6 was to prepare ...e5 on the next move to gain space in the centre. The immediate 5...e5?! is met by 6.Bb5+!, when Black must either play 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7. White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterised by 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 0-0 8.Qd2 Nc6. The Classical Variation of the Dragon leads to a less ferocious game. White's pressure on the d6-pawn often compels Black to respond to Bxf6 with ...gxf6. White's third most common move is 6.Be2, (ECO codes B58–B59), after which Black can remain in independent variations with the Boleslavsky Variation 6...e5. The old main line 7.B3 is now less popular than the modern 7.Nf3, after which the game usually continues. The Sveshnikov Variation was popularised in the 1970s and 80s. It is extremely popular among grandmasters and amateurs alike. The main line after 5...e5 runs as follows:6. Ndb5The theoretically critical move, threatening Nd6+. All other moves are considered to allow Black easy equality. The entire variation up to 8...b5 is referred to as the Chelyabinsk Variation. The Kalashnikov Variation is a close relative of the Sveshnikov Variations. Black develops the bishop to g7 in the Accelerated Dragon Variation. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4, the Maróczy Bind. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov–Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986. Black's move 2...e6 gives priority to developing the dark-squared bishop. After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 ( the Kan Variation) and 4 ...Nf6. White's second most popular reply is 5.Nc3, when Black's development of the kingside knight often takes focus. Black normally plays a move to control the e5-square and prevent the pawn from advancing. The Four Knights Variation is mainly used as a way to get into the main line Sveshnikov Variation, reached after 6.Ndb5 d6. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6, White's most important alternative to 3.d4 is 3.Bb5+. Grandmasters sometimes choose this variation when they wish to avoid theory. The most frequent continuation is 3...Nf6 4.Be2, when 4...Nxe4? loses to 5.Qa4+ and likewise 4 ...Nc6 5 d4 Nxe4?: loses to 6 d5 and 7 Qa4+. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3, Black has some less commonly played options apart from 2...d6, 2...Nc6 and 2...e6. White's strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3, when 5...b6?, as Nimzowitsch played and recommended, loses to 6.e6! f6. 2...Nc6 is the most common choice, but 2...e6 and 2...d6 are often played. Black has various replies to 2.Nc3 in the Open Sicilian. The Alapin Variation or c3 Sicilian is popular. Players usually enter the Grand Prix Attack by playing 2Nc4 before 3f3. 2.d3 signals White's intention to develop along King's Indian Attack lines, and usually transposes to the Closed Sicilian. White often supports the e5-pawn with 3.f4 or 3.Nf3. The drawback of 2.e5 is that no additional pressure is brought to the centre. The Sicilian Defence has more codes than any other opening.

      "\"The Sicilian Defence is a chess opening that begins with the following moves:1.e4 c5ECOB20–B99OriginGiulio Cesare Polerio, 1594Named afterSicilyParentKing's Pawn Game. The Sicilian Defence was popular for much of the nineteenth century. It fell out of favour when some of the world's leading players rejected it. The Sicilian was not seen even in the 75 games played at the St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. It was played six times (out of 110 games) at New York 1924. Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov are two of the most famous players to have played the Sicilian Defence. The Sicilian is the most played and most analysed opening at both the club and master levels. It is Black's most dynamic, asymmetrical reply to 1.e4. After 2.Nf3 there are three options for Black: 2...d6, 2...Nc6, and 2...e6. The Najdorf Variation is Black's most popular system in the Sicilian Defence. White's intention with 5...a6 was to prepare ...e5 on the next move to gain space in the centre. The immediate 5...e5?! is met by 6.Bb5+!, when Black must either play 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7. White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterised by 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 0-0 8.Qd2 Nc6. The Classical Variation of the Dragon leads to a less ferocious game. White's pressure on the d6-pawn often compels Black to respond to Bxf6 with ...gxf6. White's third most common move is 6.Be2, (ECO codes B58–B59), after which Black can remain in independent variations with the Boleslavsky Variation 6...e5. The old main line 7.B3 is now less popular than the modern 7.Nf3, after which the game usually continues. The Sveshnikov Variation was popularised in the 1970s and 80s. It is extremely popular among grandmasters and amateurs alike. The main line after 5...e5 runs as follows:6. Ndb5The theoretically critical move, threatening Nd6+. All other moves are considered to allow Black easy equality. The entire variation up to 8...b5 is referred to as the Chelyabinsk Variation. The Kalashnikov Variation is a close relative of the Sveshnikov Variations. Black develops the bishop to g7 in the Accelerated Dragon Variation. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4, the Maróczy Bind. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov–Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986. Black's move 2...e6 gives priority to developing the dark-squared bishop. After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 ( the Kan Variation) and 4 ...Nf6. White's second most popular reply is 5.Nc3, when Black's development of the kingside knight often takes focus. Black normally plays a move to control the e5-square and prevent the pawn from advancing. The Four Knights Variation is mainly used as a way to get into the main line Sveshnikov Variation, reached after 6.Ndb5 d6. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6, White's most important alternative to 3.d4 is 3.Bb5+. Grandmasters sometimes choose this variation when they wish to avoid theory. The most frequent continuation is 3...Nf6 4.Be2, when 4...Nxe4? loses to 5.Qa4+ and likewise 4 ...Nc6 5 d4 Nxe4?: loses to 6 d5 and 7 Qa4+. After 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3, Black has some less commonly played options apart from 2...d6, 2...Nc6 and 2...e6. White's strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3, when 5...b6?, as Nimzowitsch played and recommended, loses to 6.e6! f6. 2...Nc6 is the most common choice, but 2...e6 and 2...d6 are often played. Black has various replies to 2.Nc3 in the Open Sicilian. The Alapin Variation or c3 Sicilian is popular. Players usually enter the Grand Prix Attack by playing 2Nc4 before 3f3. 2.d3 signals White's intention to develop along King's Indian Attack lines, and usually transposes to the Closed Sicilian.
