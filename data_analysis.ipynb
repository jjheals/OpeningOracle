The Sicilian Defence was popular for much of the nineteenth century. It fell out of favour when some of the world's leading players rejected it. The Sicilian was not seen even in the 75 games played at the St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. It was played six times (out of 110 games) at New York 1924. Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov are two of the most famous players to have played the Sicilian Defence. The Sicilian is the most played and most analysed opening at both the club and master levels. It is Black's most dynamic, asymmetrical reply to 1.e4. After 2.Nf3 there are three options for Black: 2...d6, 2...Nc6, and 2...e6. The Najdorf Variation is Black's most popular system in the Sicilian Defence. White's intention with 5...a6 was to prepare ...e5 on the next move to gain space in the centre. The immediate 5...e5?! is met by 6.Bb5+!, when Black must either play 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7. White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterised by 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 0-0 8.Qd2 Nc6. The Classical Variation of the Dragon leads to a less ferocious game. White's pressure on the d6-pawn often compels Black to respond to Bxf6 with ...gxf6. White's third most common move is 6.Be2, (ECO codes B58–B59), after which Black can remain in independent variations with the Boleslavsky Variation 6...e5. The old main line 7.B3 is now less popular than the modern 7.Nf3, after which the game usually continues. The Sveshnikov Variation was popularised in the 1970s and 80s. It is extremely popular among grandmasters and amateurs alike. The main line after 5...e5 runs as follows:6. Ndb5The theoretically critical move, threatening Nd6+. All other moves are considered to allow Black easy equality. The entire variation up to 8...b5 is referred to as the Chelyabinsk Variation. The Kalashnikov Variation is a close relative of the Sveshnikov Variations. Black develops the bishop to g7 in the Accelerated Dragon Variation. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4, the Maróczy Bind. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov–Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986.
