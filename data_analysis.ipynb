      "\"The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. The most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. Black usually plays 5...f3 to defend the e-pawn, with 5...Bg6 preparing the sharp line 5...Qd6. White steers clear of the Marshall Attack and any of the anti-Marshall lines. The Marshall Attack is a very sharp system in which a great amount of theoretical knowledge is vital. Black generally goes all-in with a massive kingside attack, which has been analysed to great depth. The Zaitsev Variation (also called the Flohr–Zaitseve Variation) was advocated by Igor ZaitSEv, who was one of Karpov's trainers for many years. With 9...Bb7 Black prepares to put more pressure on e4 after 10.d4 Re8 and 11.Nbd2 Bf8. The Kholmov Variation, 9...Be6, was popular in the 1980s but is now played less often at the master level. The Berlin and Schliemann Defences are the most popular today. Henry Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9−13=3. The Classical Defence or Cordel Defence (ECO C64), 3...Bc5, is possibly the oldest defence to the Ruy Lopez.\"\n",

The Berlin Defence, 3...Nf6, has long had a reputation for solidity and drawishness and is commonly referred to as \"the Berlin Wall\" The Berlin is assigned ECO codes C65–C67. White's most important continuations after 4...Bc5 are 5.0-0, 5.Bxc6, and 5.c3. An uncommon reply to 4.d3 is 4...Ne7, which tries to set up the Mortimer Trap. The main replies for Black are 4...dxc6 and 4...bxc6. The latter of which is playable in the Berlin Defense, unlike the Exchange Variation in the Morphy Defense. Less-common third moves for Black:3...Bb4 (Alapin Defence)3...Qf6 (Gunderam Variation) 3...f6.\"\n",

The Four Pawns Attack is White's most ambitious line against the Alekhine's. Black allows White to make several tempo-gaining attacks on the knight. The game can become very sharp since White must either secure an advantage in space or make use of it before Black succeeds in making a successful strike at it. While the main target of Black is d4, the pawn on c4 also can be pressurized considerably via ...Na5. Black must also play vigorously because passive play will be crushed by the white centre. The Voronezh Variation is the most common response to Black's 5...exd6 line. Black usually aims to attack and undermine the white pawn on d4, and possibly c4 as well. After 10.d5 Ne5 Black's knight lacks a target, and will soon be chased out with f2–f4. Other solid moves such as 9...e6, ...Bd7,...Bf5, and ...a5 are possible. Black will often voluntarily surrender by parries with 5Be2 or 5Be3. 4...dxe5 (the Larsen Variation) eliminates the advanced pawn, but brings forward the white knight after 5.Nxe5. Challenging this knight immediately with 5...Nd7 can lead to the sharp sacrificial line 5. Nxe5 Nd7 6.Nxf7!? Kxf7 7.Qh5+ Ke6. White's most popular move is 6.Be2 (6.Bd3!?) when Black continues with either the immediate 6...nd7 or 6...Bf5. In the Two Knights Variation, White immediately accepts doubled pawns after 3...Nxc3 for some compensation. After 4.dxc3 this compensation is rapid piece development. Black must play 4...Nd5, whereupon White will usually challenge the knight with moves like Bc4 and Nc3. The statistics presented by Cox show this variation scoring poorly for White, with all of Black's main defences scoring at least 50%. The first recorded use of the Brooklyn Variation was in 1905 in Vienna where Adolf Aronzowitsch with white checkmated on the 34th move. 2.Nc3 is by far White's most common alternative to 2.e5. The independent Alekhine line is 2...d5, known as the Scandinavian Variation. White gets a large advantage with 3.d4 f6, or 3...e6 4.Nh3 h6 5.Qg4 d5 6.f3 h5 7.Qf4 g5 8.Nxg5 Nxg 5 9.Qxg4 Be7 10.Qe6+! 7.Be2 or 7.Ne2, 7...Bd7 is unpleasant. After 3...d4, Black can choose among 3...Nfd7 (transposing to the Steinitz variation of the French Defence after 4. d4 e6, but 4.e6!? is a sharp alternative), 3...Ne4!?, and even 3....Ng8. 2.Bc4, the Krejczik Variation, is rarely seen, since it allows Black to gain the bishop pair and seize space in the centre. After 2...Nxe4 3.Bxf7+ (the Krejcik Gambit) Kxf7 4.Qh5+ Kg8 or 4...g6 5.Qd5+ e6 6.Qxe4 Bg7 7.Qf4 Ke8! \"Black has nothing to worry about,\" says Alburt and Schiller.\"\n",

      "\"The Sicilian Defence is a chess opening that begins with the following moves:1. e4 c5. The Sicilian is the most popular and best-scoring response to White's first move 1.e4. It is named after Giulio Cesare Polerio, who analysed it in his 1594 book King's Pawn Game. Black's c5-pawn is traded for White's d4-p pawn in the early stages of the game. The pawn trade also opens the c-file for Black, who can place a rook or queen on that file. The Sicilian Defence was popular for much of the nineteenth century. It fell out of favour when some of the world's leading players rejected it. The Sicilian was not seen even once in the 75 games played at the great St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. Some leading players, such as Emanuel Lasker and Frank Tartakower, occasionally played the opening. It has been practised with 1...P-K4 at Black's disposal and has been considered the best of the irregular defences to 1...e5. The Sicilian Defence is one of the most popular openings in chess. It is used by most grandmasters to counter the opening of 1.e4. Black's most common move after 2.Nf3 is 2...d6 which prepares ...Nf6 to attack the e-pawn without letting White push it to e5. Black can then choose between four major variations: the Najdorf, Dragon, Classical and Scheveningen. The rare Kupreichik Variation (5...Bd7) may transpose to one of more common variations such as the Classical or Dragon. Najdorf Variation: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Be3 e6 7.g4 7.Bb3 Qc7 8.Bc4 0-0 9.0-0 Be6 10.exf6 Qa5 9.5-5 d5 10.dxc5! 9.e5 dxe9 9.bxc5 d4 9.dxe9 10.xg5 d6 9.Bxc5 D4 10.Xg5 D6 9...Qc7 10.Bxd7 Nbxd7 11.Bd3 Nbd7 12.Nb3 Nbd7 13.Nbd7 Bd7 14.Nd7 Nd7 15.Ne7 Nf7 16.Nxe7 17.Nxf7 18.Nxg7 19.Nxa7 20. Nxe7 21. Nxa7 22. Nxf7 23. Nxh7. The Dragon Variation was named by Fyodor Dus-Chotimirsky in 1901. White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterised by 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 0-0 8.Qd2 Nc6. The game becomes a race between White's kingside attack and Black's queenside counterattack. Black usually plays 6...e6 (ECO B88 transposed) to limit the range of White's bishop, but White can eventually put pressure on the e6-pawn. Scheveningen Variation: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6. Sveshnikov Variation was pioneered by Evgeny SvesHnikov and Gennadi Timoshchenko in the 1970s. The old main line 7.Nb3 is now less popular than the modern 7.nf3, after which the game usually continues 7...h6 8.0-0 Be7 9.Re1 0-0 10.h3. The Sveshnikov Variation is a popular move order in chess. It can also be reached from the alternate move order 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Na3 b5 9.Bxf6 or 9.Nd5. Black's ...e5 push seems anti-positional: it makes the d6-pawn backward and the d5-square weak. The Sveshnikov Variation is a close relative of the Sicilian Defence. The move 4...e5 has had a long history; Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais used it in his matches against Alexander McDonnell in 1834. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4, the Maróczy Bind. Black avoids playing ...d7–d6 and can later play ...d 7–d5 in one move if possible. After 5...Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Nc3 and now 7...0-0 or 7...Ng4 is most frequently played. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov–Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986. Black's move 2...e6 gives priority to developing the dark-squared bishop. After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 ( the Kan Variation) and 4 ...Nf6. The Four Knights Variation is mainly used as a way of getting into the main line Sveshnikov Variation. The Pin Variation (also called the Sicilian Counter-Attack) is considered theoretically suspect, but if White is unprepared the tactics can be difficult to calculate at the board. White can play 2.Nf3 without intending to follow up with 3.d4. The systems given below are usually classified along with White's second move alternatives as Anti-Sicilians. White generally answers with 6.Bd3, supporting the e4-pawn. The Rossolimo Variation, 3.Bb5, is a well-respected alternative to 3.d4. White's usual intention is to play Bxc6, giving Black doubled pawns. The Italian American Grandmaster Fabiano Caruana is perhaps the biggest proponent of this line at the top level, and has played this variation in Games 1,3 and 5 of his World Championship Match against Magnus Carlsen. Black sometimes plays 3...e5 to avoid both moves; then 4.Bc4 is considered White's best move. 2...Nf62 ...Nf6 is the Nimzowitsch Variation. White's strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3, when 5...b6? loses to 6.e6! f6 7.Ne5! or 4...e6 (the main line) 2...Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.D3 d62 is White's second most common move responding to 1.e4 c5. 2.c3 is the Alapin Variation or c3 Sicilian. Black's best reply is 2...d5 3.exd5 Nf6!, the Tal Gambit, which has caused the immediate 2.f4 to decline in popularity. White may decline the gambit with 3.Nc3, called the \"Toilet Variation\", so named after its reputed place of invention. Other reasonable moves include: 2.Ne2 is the Keres Variation, a favourite of Paul Keres. 2.e5 is an eccentric move recently returned to prominence by GM Vadim Zvjaginsev at the 2005 Russian Chess Championship Superfinal. 2.Qh5, threatening the c-pawn as in the Wayward Queen Attack, was played twice in 2005 by Hikaru Nakamura, but the move is considered dubious. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings classifies the Sicilian Defence under the codes B20 through B99, giving it more codes than any other opening. The most important variations included are the Rossolimo, Kalashnikov, Sveshnikov and Accelerated Dragon. The Sicilian Defence is one of the most popular chess openings. It is named after the Sicilian city of Sveshnikov. The Sicilian defence is based on the 1.e4 Sicilian Variation.
