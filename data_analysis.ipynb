It was played six times (out of 110 games) at New York 1924 Chess Openings (4th edition) The Sicilian Defence is the most commonly used opening in chess. It is designed to give Black the most chances against 1.e4. Most leading grandmasters include the Sicilian in their opening repertoire. After 2.Nf3 there are three main options for Black: 2...d6, 2...Nc6, and 2...e6. The game usually continues 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3. There are a few ways for either side to deviate from the heading. Najdorf Variation is Black's most popular system in the Sicilian Defence. Najdorf's intention with 5...a6 was to prepare ...e5 on the next move to gain space in the centre. The immediate 5...e5?! is met by 6.Bb5+!, when Black must either play 6...Bd7 or 6...Nbd7. White could also protect the pawn on e4 with 5.Bd3 which allows the option of setting up a Maróczy Bind formation with a later c2-c4. In the Dragon Variation, Black fianchettoes a bishop on the h8–a1 diagonal. White's most dangerous try against the Dragon is the Yugoslav Attack, characterised by 6.Be3 Bg7 7.f3 0-0 8.Qd2 Nc6. The game becomes a race between White's kingside attack and Black's queenside counterattack. Black usually plays 6...e6 (ECO B88 transposed) to limit the range of White's bishop, but White can eventually put pressure on the e6-pawn. Scheveningen Variation: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e6. Sveshnikov Variation was pioneered by Evgeny Sveschnikov and Gennadi Timoshchenko [ru] in the 1970s. Emanuel Lasker played it in his world championship match against Carl Schlechter and Jorge Pelikan played in the 1950s. The Sveshnikov Variation has become very popular in master level chess. Top players who have used this variation include Magnus Carlsen, Vladimir Kramnik, Veselin Topalov, Teimour Radjabov, Boris Gelfand, Michael Adams and Alexander Khalifman. It can also be reached from the alternate move order 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 e6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Bg5 a6 8.Na3 b5, which is one move longer. The Sveshnikov Variation is a close relative of the Sicilian Defence. The move 4...e5 has had a long history; Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais used it in his matches against Alexander McDonnell in 1834, and it was also popular for a short time in the 1940s. The critical test of Black's move order is 5.c4, the Maróczy Bind. The main line runs 5...Bg7 6.Be3 Nf6 7.Nc3 and now 7...Ng4. The Kasparov Gambit 8...d5 was played twice in the World Chess Championship 1985, but virtually disappeared from master praxis after the game Karpov–Van der Wiel, Brussels (SWIFT) 1986. Black's move 2...e6 gives priority to developing the dark-squared bishop. After 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4, Black has three main moves: 4...Nc6 (the Taimanov Variation), 4...a6 ( the Kan Variation) and 4 ...Nf6. The Four Knights Variation is mainly used as a way of getting into the main line Sveshnikov Variation. The Pin Variation (also called the Sicilian Counter-Attack) is considered theoretically suspect, but if White is unprepared the tactics can be difficult to calculate at the board. White can play 2.Nf3 without intending to follow up with 3.d4. The systems given below are usually classified along with White's second move alternatives as Anti-Sicilians. Black has: 6...Ne4?! 7.Qg4! Nxc3 8.Qxg7 Rf8 9.a3 Nb5+. The Rossolimo Variation, 3.Bb5, is a well-respected alternative to 3.d4. The Italian American Grandmaster Fabiano Caruana is perhaps the biggest proponent of this line at the top level, and has played this variation in Games 1,3 and 5 of his World Championship Match against Magnus Carlsen. White sometimes plays 3.Nc3 as a waiting move, though it has little independent significance. 3.c3 transposes to lines of the Alapin Variation after 3...Nf6 or 3...d5. 2...Nf62 ...Nf6 is the Nimzowitsch Variation. White's strongest reply is to chase the knight by 3.e5 Nd5 4.Nc3 and now (a) 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3, when 5...b6? loses to 6.e6! f6 7.Ne5! or 4...e6 (the main line) 2...Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.D3 d62 is White's second most common move responding to 1.e4 c5. 2.c3 is the Alapin Variation or c3 Sicilian. Black's best reply is 2...d5 3.exd5 Nf6!, the Tal Gambit, which has caused the immediate 2.f4 to decline in popularity. The modern main line runs 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.F4 g6 4.Nf3 Bg7. Other reasonable moves include: 2.Ne2 is the Keres Variation, a favourite of Paul Keres, and has similar ideas to the Chameleon System discussed under 2.C3. 2.e5 is an eccentric move recently returned to prominence by GM Vadim Zvjaginsev at the 2005 Russian Chess Championship Superfinal. 2.Qh5, threatening the c-pawn as in the Wayward Queen Attack, was played twice in 2005 by Hikaru Nakamura, but the move is considered dubious. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings classifies the Sicilian Defence under the codes B20 through B99, giving it more codes than any other opening. The most important variations included are the Rossolimo, Kalashnikov, Sveshnikov and Accelerated Dragon. The Sicilian Defence is one of the most popular openings in chess. It is based on the idea that the Sicilian \"prevents every attack\" Modern players would consider the notion that it is naive to think that this is the case. The opening is named after the city of St. Petersburg, where the tournament took place in 1914. The Sicilian Variation is also known as the Najdorf Variation. There are also several other Sicilian variations, including the Sveshnikov Variation, which is named for the Russian player of the same name.\"\n",

This name is derived from an article about 3... b5!? by B. Argunow written in Kuibyshev (Samara since 1991), Russia. The Pal Benko gambit is a chess opening named after the eponym. It is a popular opening at amateur level, where it is considered to offer Black good practical chances of playing for a win. Many of the world's strongest players have used it at one time or another, including former world champions Viswanathan Anand, Garry Kasparov, Veselin Topalov, and Mikhail Tal. The most popular line is 4...bxc4, the Sosonko Accepted, which often leads to sharp and sacrificial lines.\"\n",

The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5. The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. Black often sets up a Hedgehog formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6), while White will try to pursue a strategy of gaining queenside space with b4 and c5. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are common replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 6.Nf3 Na6). In the former case, the bishop will eventually retreat to e7 and Black will set up a Hedgehog formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6) White almost always plays 5.dxc5. After 5...Qxd5, Black can either recapture with the pawn or defend with the queen. 4...Nc6 is the Zürich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. White usually plays on the queenside in this variation, while Black will try to play on the kingside with ...f5. Garry Kasparov used it to great effect against Anatoly Karpov in their 1985 World Championship match.

      "\"The Budapest Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 e5. The first known game with the gambit is Adler–Maróczy (played in Budapest in 1896) The Hungarian players István Abonyi, Zsigmond Barász and Gyula Breyer further developed the opening. It enjoyed a rise in popularity in the early 1920s, but nowadays is rarely played at the top level. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game or cripple White's pawn structure. Budapest Gambit reached its peak of popularity (around five Budapest Gambits for every thousand games played) around 1920. Top players like Savielly Tartakower and Siegbert Tarrasch started to play it. By the end of the 1920s, despite the invention of the highly original Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 in 1928, the Budapest Gambit was considered theoretically dubious. In the 21st century, despite Shakhriyar Mamedyarov's successful efforts to rehabilitate the line 4.Bf4 g5, the gambit almost never appears at the highest level. The Budapest Gambit is an old opening, seldom used by champions without having fallen in disgrace. Black gets a good pawn structure and possibilities of attack on the kingside. His problems generally come from the white pressure on the d-column and a lack of space to manoeuvre his pieces. White does not try to defend his e5-pawn and keep his material advantage, but instead he concentrates on building an imposing pawn centre. Black lets White build his pawn centre only to undermine it later, a playing philosophy espoused in the teachings of the hypermodern school. In most variations Black has the opportunity to play Bb4+. The advisability of this move depends on White's possible answers. The c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. In the Rubinstein variation 3...Ng4 4.Nf3, after White has moved f2–f4, the e3-pawn becomes a backward pawn on an open file. Black can then apply pressure on the e-file in general and the e4-square in particular. In order to build up these potential advantages, the most common plan is to perform a minority attack on the queens. 4.Bf4 is the most dangerous move for Black. It aims to answer 4...Bc5 with 5.e3 without blocking the Bc1. The sideline 4...g5!? was not well regarded until the end of the 20th century. White can try to exploit weaknesses with the manoeuvres Bf4–d2–c3 (pressure along the diagonal a1–h8), Ng1–e2–g3–h5 (pressure against the squares f6 and g7) and h2–h4. 5...Nxe5 6.Bc3 Qe7 7.e3 Rg8! 8.Nf3 Nbc6 9.Be2 d6 10.Nd4 Bd7 11.b4 g4 with good counterplay for Black on kingside. 6...Nxf3+ 7.exf3 when both 7...h5? and 7...Bg7 would fail to 8.Qe2+, so Black must try 7...d6 8. qe2+ Be6 instead. 8...Qa3 puts pressure on the white queenside pawns, pressure that may later be intensified with Nf6–e4. After 7.a3 White will win the bishop pair. Black has not a lot of things to be proud of as there are no targets in White's camp. Black's Ne5 is strongly centralised, attacks the c4-pawn, and restricts the Bf1 from moving to the natural squares d3 and f3. White will try to use the advances b2–b4 or c4–c5 in good conditions, supported by the queen and the rooks on the c-file and the d-file. After 7.e3, White concentrates on castling and tries to avoid the move a2–a3 in order to gain a tempo over the 7.a3 variation. The game will take an entirely different structure depending on whether Black gives up the bishop pair or tries to keep it. White has to choose if he wants to start active operations on the queenside immediately (e.g. Rc1, Qc3, c5) or if he want to finish his development first (with Be2 and 0-0). The immediate 11.c5!? is a possible pawn sacrifice. After 9.Be2 b6 10.0-0 Bxd2 11.Qxd2 Bb7 12.Qc3 f6 13.b4 c5!? and Lalic was \"deeply impressed by this plan, which really spoils all of White's fun\". The c4-pawn is never allowed to advance, so that the Be2 is durably restricted. The Bf4 is obstructed by the Ne5, that cannot be easily removed. The weakness of the d7- pawn is not a worry as it can be protected by Bb 7–c6 if necessary. Tseitlin considers that with a knight on c5 the move d7–d6 should be avoided if Black has to respond to the capture Bxc5 by dxc5. So Black does best to attack with pieces, possibly with the setup b6/Nc5/Bb7/ 0-0-0. After the better 8...Bc5 9.Bxc5 Qxc5 10.Qf3 Lalic recommends 10...a5.[118] The introduction of the intermediate 7...Qh4+ 8.g3 Qe7 does not change Lalic's opinion. The Fajarowicz variation is said to have its origins in the chess circles from Leipzig, with the first important game being H.Steiner–Fajerowicz at the 1928 Wiesbaden tournament. In this variation, Black makes no immediate effort to regain the gambit pawn, preferring to concentrate on active piece play and tactical tricks. The line 3...Ne4 4.Qc2 Bb4+1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Ne4. 4...Bb4+ (see diagram) pins the white pieces before deciding what to do with the Ne4. White cannot reply 5.Bd2 as he would lose the bishop pair and Black would easily regain the e5-pawn with Nc6/Qe7/0-0/Re8. After 5.Nd2 this knight would be misplaced and would block the Bc1, so Black could open the game with 5...d5 in favourable circumstances. The Budapest Gambit is a variation of the Queen's Gambit.

Nxe5 4.d4 intending 5.e4, rather than 3.nf3?! g5! when Black stands well. After the normal 2...d6 3.exd6 Bxd6, White must play 4.Nf3, avoiding 4.c3?? Qh4+ 5.g3 Qxg3+ 6.hxg 3 Bxg2! or 4...Nf6, threatening 5...Ng4. The offbeat 1...b6!? is also known, and more soundly based than the same move after 1.e4 or 1.d4. The Swiss Gambit was named by Alexander Wagner (1868–1942), a Polish chess player and openings analyst who introduced it in the Swiss correspondence game Wagner–Kostin, 1910–11. Another offbeat try is Martin Appleberry's 1...Nh6!?, also known as the Horsefly, which exploits the closed c1-h6 diagonal. 1.f4 ranks sixth in popularity in Chessgames.com's database. It is less than one-twentieth as popular as the mirror image English Opening (1.c4) The move slightly weakens White's king's position. Black's most successful response to Bird's Opening in the 1600-2200 rating range is e5, where Black's win percentage is 50-46%, but that evens to 48-48% when White plays 2.fxe5. The five more popular openings are still substantially more successful for White. Chess is a popular game of chess. Chess tournaments include the World Chess Championship and the FIDE Grand Prix. Chess is an important part of the arts and culture. chess is also used in music, film, and literature. Chess has its roots in the ancient city of Budapest in Hungary. Chess was first played in the 13th century by Peter Boltzmann in what is now known as the Budapest Gambit. The opening of a chess game is often referred to as the first game.\"\n",

      "\"The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 e63. Nc3 Bb4. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings, it is classified as E20–E59. It was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. It is a highly respected defence to 1.d4 and has been played by every world champion since Capablanca. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response to 4...e5. The Karpov Variation is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. The Larsen Variation (named after GM Bent Larsen) can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Ba5 or 7...Nc6 8.A3 Bxc3 dxc3 9.bxc3 Qc7 (Main Variation) The Main Variation was enormously popular in the 1950s, but the name has become increasingly inappropriate. After 4.e3 0-0 White has a huge selection of moves to choose from. Black must be familiar with all of them. White will try to advance their centre pawns to free their bishops: c4, d5, and f3 followed by e4 are all possible. If Black can prevent White from achieving this, then they will enjoy the better game. In the Rubinstein, White has often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight. 4.e3 is a well-known move in chess. There are two major variations particular to 4...c5: 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3 (6.Ne2 will likely transpose to the Modern Variation) 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 is the Hübner Variation, popularized by GM Robert HüBner in the late 1960s and '70s and utilised by Bobby Fischer in his world championship match with Boris Spassky. The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5. The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. Black often sets up a Hedgehog formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6), while White will try to pursue a strategy of gaining queenside space with b4 and c5. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are all common replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5 or 5... 0-0 6.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 b6 7.Bg5) or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 6.Nf3 Na6) The Pirc Variation was not popular during the mid-20th century, because the lines where Black eventually recaptures with theKnight was reckoned to give Black easy equality. 4...Nc6 is the Zürich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. 4...d5 transposes to the Ragozin Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined and 4...b6. The Nimzo/Queen's Indian hybrid line is the most common move that stays within Nimzo-Indian territory. After 6.Nf3 Qf5 7.Qxf5 exf5, Black strengthens his grip on e4 and makes e6 available for the bishop.

The McCutcheon Variation is named for John Lindsay McCutheon of Philadelphia (1857–1905), who brought the variation to public attention when he used it to defeat World Champion Steinitz in a simultaneous exhibition in Manhattan in 1885. The main line of the Steinitz is 5.f4 c5 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Be3. Black may step up the pressure on d4 by playing 7...Qb6 or 7...cxd4 8.Nxd4 Qb6, begin queenside play with 7...a6 8.Qd2 b5, or continue kingside development by 7...Be7 or 7.Nxf6+ Nxf6. 3...Nf6 is known as the Guimard Variation. 3...Nc6 is a move that breaks open the centre. After 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Bd3 c5 6.c3 Nc6 6.Bb5 Bd6 7.0-0 Nge7 8.dxc5 Bxc5 9.Nb3 Bb6 4...exd5 was a staple of many old Karpov–Korchnoi battles, including seven games in their 1974 FIDE Candidates match. The main line of the Advance Variation continues 3...c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 and then we have a branching point:5...Qb6. The idea is to increase the pressure on d4 and eventually undermine the white centre. The queen also attacks the b2-square, so White's dark-square bishop cannot easily defend the d4-pawn. White's most common replies are 6.a3, 6.Be2 and 6.Bd3. Black may continue developing with 6...Nh6, intending ...Nf5. Despite the symmetrical pawn structure, White cannot force a draw. An obsession with obtaining one sometimes results in embarrassment for White. White will often play c2–c4 at some stage to put pressure on Black's d5-pawn. Black can give White an isolated queen's pawn by capturing on c4, but this gives White's pieces greater freedom. Another way to unbalance the position is for White or Black to castle on opposite sides of the board. This occurs in lines such as 3.exd5 exd5 4.c4 (played by GMs Normunds Miezis and Maurice Ashley) and 4.Nf3 Bd6. The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence between the cities of London and Paris in 1834. Black usually replies 2...c5, after which play can resemble the 2.d3 variation or the Closed Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Play can continue 2...d5 3. e5 c5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5.c3 Nge7 6.Na3 Nf5. There are also a few rare continuations after 1.e4 e6 2. d4 d5, including 3.Bd3 and 3.Be3. The Exchange Variation was recommended by Howard Staunton in the 19th century. In the early 1990s, Garry Kasparov briefly experimented with it before switching to 3.Nc3. It has the reputation of giving immediate equality to Black due to the symmetrical pawn structure. The Advance declined in popularity, however, throughout most of the 20th century until it was revived in the 1980s by GM and prominent opening theoretician Evgeny Sveshnikov. In recent years, it has become nearly as popular as 3. nd2; GM Alexander Grischuk has championed it successfully at the highest levels.\"\n",

The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience, although some lines such as the Winawer Variation can lead to sharp complications. Black's position is often somewhat cramped in the early game; in particular, the pawn on e6 can impede the development of the bishop. In the diagrammed position, Black most frequently plays 6...Ne7. White can exploit the absence of Black's dark-square bishop by playing 7.Qg4, giving Black two choices: he may sacrifice his kingside pawns with 7...Qc7 8.Qxg7 Rg8 or he can play 7...0-0 8.Bd3 Nbc6. A more recent alternative is 7...Kf8, which tries to make use of the locked pawn centre (the king is safe from central attacks, and can run away from a kingside attack) The Burn Variation is the most common reply at the top level. Black can also try 5...Be7 6.Bxf6 gxf6, as played by Alexander Morozevich and Gregory Kaidanov.

      "\"The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. Due to the difficulty for Black in achieving equality, a common nickname for the opening is \"The Spanish Torture\" The most commonly played third move for Black is the Morphy Defence, 3...a6, a move that forces White to retreat or exchange for Black's knight. The opening remains the most commonly used amongst the open games in master play; it has been adopted by almost all players. 3...a6 is played in over 65 percent of all games beginning with the Ruy Lopez. The most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. Black almost always responds 4...dxc6. The Exchange Variation, 4.Bxc6, (ECO C68–C69) White damages Black's pawn structure, gaining a ready-made long-term plan of playing d4 ...exd4 Qxd4, followed by exchanging all the pieces and winning. The Norwegian Variation (also called the Taimanov or Wing Variation) (ECO C70), 3...a6 4.Ba4 b5 5.Bb3 Na5 aims to eliminate the white bishop but is generally considered too time-consuming for Black. In the Modern Steinitz Defence, White is able to maintain control of the centre by playing 5c3, 5c4, 5d, and 5c0. The sharp Siesta Variation arises from the calmer 6c3 f5. The Schliemann Defence Deferred, 3...a6 4.Ba4 f5, is rarely seen, with practically its only top-level appearance being in the 1974 Candidates Final, when Viktor Korchnoi adopted it versus Anatoly Karpov. There are six ECO classifications for the Modern Steinitz. White's responses 5.d4, 5.Nc3, and 5.c4 are included in C71, while 5.0-0 is C72. The delayed exchange 5.Bxc6+ bxc6 6. d4 is C73. The Modern Arkhangelsk Defence (or Modern Archangel Defence) (ECO C78) is a refinement of the regular Arkhangel's Defence by incorporating ideas similar to the Møller Defence. Black normally does not fianchetto the queen's bishop, but plays ...Bg4 to increase the pressure against White's pawn centre. Fabiano Caruana is one of the most notable players of this variation, employing it in the Candidates Tournament 2020. The Riga Variation, 6...exd4, is considered inferior; the main line runs 7.Re1 d5 8.Nxd4 Bd6! The Dilworth Variation (or Attack), 11...Nxf2 12.Rxf2 f6 13.exf6 Bxf2+ 14.Kxf2 Qxf6 has scored well for Black. In the Howell Attack (ECO C81), 9.Qe2, White aims for play against d5 after Rd1. Paul Keres played this line against Max Euwe and Samuel Reshevsky at the World Chess Championship tournament 1948. The main line leads to unbalanced endgames which are difficult to play for both sides. 6.d3, often called the Martinez Variation, steers clear of the Marshall Attack and any of the anti-Marshall lines. Paul Keres and Boris Spassky have both played the line a few times throughout their careers. Siegbert Tarrasch played it three times in his 1911 match against Schlechter (scoring 1 win, 1 draw, 1 loss in that order), but it remains the least popular option for White on move 6. After 6...d6 the e5-pawn is firmly defended and Black threatens to trade off White's Ruy Lopez bishop with 7...b5 and 8...Na5. 6.d3 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.a4 b4 9.a5 d6 10.Nbd2 Be6 11.Nc4!, where White can transpose directly to the anti-Marshall line if desired by playing Re1 later. If Black elects not to exchange, however, we may see 11. nbd2 Rb8 12.N c4 where White may retain some pull in the position. In some rare cases transpose to a traditional closed Spanish (with 7...d6) after 6...b5. The Marshall Attack is a very sharp opening system in which a great amount of theoretical knowledge is vital. Frank James Marshall used it as a prepared variation against José Raúl Capablanca in 1918. Black generally goes all-in with a massive kingside attack, which has been analysed to great depth (sometimes beyond move 30) The main line begins with 9.exd5 Nxd5 (9...e4?!, the Herman Steiner variation, is considered weaker) 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 c6 (Marshall's original moves, 11...Nf6, and 11...Bb7 are considered inferior, but have also yielded good results) The Pilnik Variation, named for Hermann Pilnik, is also known as the Teichmann Variation. White plays 9.d3 intending to later advance to d4 under favourable circumstances. The Breyer Variation was recommended by Gyula Breyer as early as 1911, but there are no known game records in which Breyer employed this line. The Chigorin Variation has declined in popularity because Black must spend some time bringing his offside knight on a5 back into the game. The Zaitsev Variation (also called the Flohr–ZaitseV Variation) was advocated by Igor ZaitSev, who was one of Karpov's trainers for many years. With 9...Bb7 Black prepares to put more pressure on e4 after 10.d4 Re8. The Kholmov Variation, 9...Be6, was popular in the 1980s but is now played less often at the master level. The Berlin and Schliemann Defences are the most popular today. The Steinitz Defence (3...d6) is solid but passive and cramped. Henry Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9−13=3. The world champion Magnus Carlsen played it in the 2014 Chess Olympiad against Ivan Šarić and lost. The Schliemann Defence (ECO C63), 3...f5 is a sharp line in which Black plays for a kingside attack, frequently sacrificing one or two pawns. This variation was originated by Carl Jaenisch in 1847. The Classical Defence or Cordel Defence (ECO C64), 3...Bc5 is possibly the oldest defence to the Ruy Lopez. Teimour Radjabov is currently the only top player who regularly employs this line, with mixed results. The name derives from White's play if Black captures the knight: 4...Nxe5 5.d4. The Berlin Defence, 3...Nf6, has long had a reputation for solidity and drawishness and is commonly referred to as \"the Berlin Wall\" The Berlin is assigned ECO codes C65–C67. White's most important continuations after 4...Bc5 are 5.0-0, 5.Bxc6, and 5.c3. An uncommon reply to 4.d3 is 4...Ne7, which tries to set up the Mortimer Trap. The main replies for Black are 4...dxc6 and 4...bxc6. The latter of which is playable in the Berlin Defense, unlike the Exchange Variation in the Morphy Defense.

The Dilworth Variation (or Attack), 11...Nxf2 12.Rxf2 f6 13.exf6 Bxf2+ 14.Kxf2 Qxf6 has scored well for Black. In the Howell Attack (ECO C81), 9.Qe2, White aims for play against d5 after Rd1. The game usually continues 9...Be7 10.Rd1 followed by 10...Nc5 or 10...0-0. In the Worrall Attack (ECO C86), White replaces 6.Re1 with 6.Qe2. Paul Keres and Boris Spassky have both played the line a few times throughout their careers. Siegbert Tarrasch played it three times in his 1911 match against Schlechter (scoring 1 win, 1 draw, 1 loss in that order), but it remains the least popular option for White on move 6. White steers clear of the Marshall Attack and any of the anti-Marshall lines. After 6...d6 the e5-pawn is firmly defended and Black threatens to trade off White's Ruy Lopez bishop. 6...b5 can be transposed to a traditional closed Spanish (with 7...d6) after something like 6.d3 d6 7.Bb3 0-0 8.a4 b4 9.a5 d6 10.Nbd2 Be6 11.Nc4!, where White can transpose directly to the anti-Marshall line if desired by playing Re1 later. If Black elects not to exchange, however, White may retain some pull in the position. In the Averbakh Variation (C87) Black defends the threatened e-pawn with 6... d6 instead of driving away the white bishop with the more common 6... b5. The Marshall Attack is the most common move after 11...c6 in modern play. Frank James Marshall used it as a prepared variation against José Raúl Capablanca in 1918. Black generally goes all-in with a massive kingside attack, which has been analysed to great depth (sometimes beyond move 30) The main line begins with 9.exd5 Nxd5 (9...e4?!, the Herman Steiner variation, is considered weaker) 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 c6 (Marshall's original moves, 11...Nf6, and 11...Bb7 are considered inferior) The Pilnik Variation, named for Hermann Pilnik, is also known as the Teichmann Variation. White plays 9.d3 intending to later advance to d4 under favourable circumstances. The Breyer Variation was recommended by Gyula Breyer as early as 1911. The Chigorin Variation has declined in popularity because Black must spend some time bringing his offside knight on a5 back into the game. Black generally plays 14g6 to stop White's knight from going to f5. The Zaitsev Variation (also called the Flohr–Zaitseva Variation) was advocated by Igor ZaitSEv, who was one of Karpov's trainers for many years. With 9...Bb7 Black prepares to put more pressure on e4 after 10.d4 Re8. The Kholmov Variation, 9...Be6, was popular in the 1980s but is now played less often at the master level. The Berlin and Schliemann Defences are the most popular today, followed by the Classical Defence. The Steinitz Defence (3...d6) is solid but passive and cramped. Henry Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9−13=3 (nine wins, thirteen losses, three draws) The world champion Magnus Carlsen played it in the 2014 Chess Olympiad against Ivan Šarić and lost. The Schliemann Defence is a sharp line in which Black plays for a kingside attack, frequently sacrificing one or two pawns. This variation was originated by Carl Jaenisch in 1847 and is sometimes named after him. The Classical Defence or Cordel Defence (ECO C64), 3...Bc5 is possibly the oldest defence to the Ruy Lopez. Teimour Radjabov is currently the only top player who regularly employs this line, with mixed results. The Berlin Defence, 3...Nf6, has long had a reputation for solidity and drawishness. The name derives from White's play if Black captures the knight: 4...Nxe5 5.d4.[edit]Main article: Berlin Defence (chess) The Berlin is assigned ECO codes C65–C67. White's most important continuations after 4...Bc5 are 5.0-0, 5.Bxc6, and 5.c3. An uncommon reply to 4.d3 is 4...Ne7, which tries to set up the Mortimer Trap. The main replies for Black are 4...dxc6 and 4...bxc6. The latter of which is playable in the Berlin Defense, unlike the Exchange Variation in the Morphy Defense. Less-common third moves for Black:3...Bb4 (Alapin Defence)3...Qf6 (Gunderam Variation)3 ...f6 and 3...Qe7.\"\n",

      "\"The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. e4 e52. Nf3 Nc63. Bb5. The opening is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. A common nickname for the opening is \"The Spanish Torture\" The Morphy Defence is the most commonly played third move for Black. It forces White to retreat or exchange for Black's knight. 3...a6 is played in over 65 percent of all games beginning with the Ruy Lopez. The most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. Black almost always responds 4...dxc6. The Exchange Variation, 4.Bxc6, (ECO C68–C69) White damages Black's pawn structure, gaining a ready-made long-term plan of playing d4 ...exd4 Qxd4, followed by exchanging all the pieces. The Graz Defence, Classical Defence Deferred, and Møller Defence combine 3...a6 with the active move ...Bc5. The Norwegian Variation (also called the Taimanov or Wing Variation) aims to eliminate the white bishop but is generally considered too time-consuming for Black. In the Modern Steinitz Defence, Black is able to maintain control of the centre. The sharp Siesta Variation arises after 5c3 f5 and 6d7d. The Schliemann Defence Deferred, 3...a6 4.Ba4 f5, is rarely seen, with practically its only top-level appearance being in the 1974 Candidates Final, when Viktor Korchnoi adopted it versus Anatoly Karpov. There are six ECO classifications for the Modern Steinitz. White's responses 5.d4, 5.Nc3, and 5.c4 are included in C71, while 5.0-0 is C72. The delayed exchange 5.Bxc6+ bxc6 6. d4 is C73. The Modern Arkhangelsk Defence (or Modern Archangel Defence) (ECO C78) is a refinement of the regular Arkhangel's Defence by incorporating ideas similar to the Møller Defence. Black normally does not fianchetto the queen's bishop, but plays ...Bg4 to increase the pressure against White's pawn centre. Fabiano Caruana is one of the most notable players of this variation, employing it in the Candidates Tournament 2020. The Riga Variation, 6...exd4, is considered inferior; the main line runs 7.Re1 d5 8.Nxc6 Bxh2+! 10.Kh1! The main line leads to unbalanced endgames which are difficult to play for both sides, though with a strong drawing tendency. The Dilworth Variation (or Attack), 11...Nxf2 12.Rxf2 f6 13.exf6 Bxf2+ 14.Kxf2 Qxf6 has scored well for Black, with many traps for the ill-prepared White player. The Howell Attack (ECO C81), 9.Qe2, White aims for play against d5 after Rd1. Paul Keres played this line against Max Euwe and Samuel Reshevsky at the World Chess Championship tournament 1948. In the Worrall Attack (ECO C86), White replaces 6.Re1 with 6.Qe2. Paul Keres and Boris Spassky have both played the line a few times throughout their careers. Siegbert Tarrasch played it three times in his 1911 match against Schlechter (scoring 1 win, 1 draw, 1 loss in that order) Nigel Short essayed it twice in his 1992 match against Anatoly Karpov and won both games. In the Martinez Variation, White steers clear of the Marshall Attack and any of the anti-Marshall lines. 6...d6 can be transposed to a traditional closed Spanish line like the Zaitsev, Flohr, Smyslov, Karpov, Breyer, or Chigorin. It is also possible to transpose to the Pilnik Variation, after 6...b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0. In the Averbakh Variation (C87) Black defends the threatened e-pawn with 6 ...d6 instead of driving away the white bishop with the more common 6... b5. The Marshall Attack is a gambit used by Frank James Marshall against José Raúl Capablanca in 1918. Black plays the gambit 8...d5, sacrificing a pawn. The most common move in modern play is 11...c6. The main line begins with 9.exd5 Nxd5 (9...e4?!, the Herman Steiner variation, is considered weaker) 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 c6, and 11...Bb7 are considered inferior, but have also yielded good results for Black. The Pilnik Variation, named for Hermann Pilnik, is also known as the Teichmann Variation. The Breyer Variation was recommended by Gyula Breyer as early as 1911. The Chigorin Variation has declined in popularity because Black must spend some time bringing his offside knight on a5 back into the game. The Karpov Variation is considered too passive, and players prefer to play the Berlin or Petroff as they seem to equalise more easily. The Zaitsev Variation (also called the Flohr–Zaitseva Variation) was advocated by Igor Zait sev, who was one of Karpov's trainers for many years. With 9...Bb7 Black prepares to put more pressure on e4 after 10.d4 Re8. The Kholmov Variation, 9...Be6, was popular in the 1980s but is now played less often at the master level. The Berlin and Schliemann Defences are the most popular today, followed by the Classical Defence. The Steinitz Defence (3...d6) is solid but passive and cramped. Henry Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9−13=3 (nine wins, thirteen losses, three draws) The world champion Magnus Carlsen played it in the 2014 Chess Olympiad against Ivan Šarić and lost. The Schliemann Defence or SchliEMann–Jaenisch Gambit (ECO C63), 3...f5,[19] is a sharp line in which Black plays for a kingside attack. The Classical Defence or Cordel Defence (ECO C64), 3...Bc5 is possibly the oldest defence to the Ruy Lopez. Teimour Radjabov is currently the only top player who regularly employs this line, with mixed results. The name derives from White's play if Black captures the knight: 4...Nxe5 5.d4. The Berlin Defence, 3...Nf6, has long had a reputation for solidity and drawishness and is commonly referred to as \"the Berlin Wall\" An important alternative is 4.d3, dubbed the Anti-Berlin, which avoids the notorious Berlin endgame.

      "\"The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening characterised by the moves 1.e4 e5, 2.Nf3 Nc6, 3.Bb5. It is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura. The Morphy Defence, 3...a6, forces White to retreat or exchange for Black's knight. It remains the most commonly used amongst the open games in master play. It has been adopted by almost all players during their careers, many have played it with both colours. 3...a6 is played in over 65 percent of all games beginning with the Ruy Lopez. The most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. After 4.Bxc6, Black almost always responds 4...dxc6. After 5...f3, Black usually plays e-c3 to defend the e-pawn, with 5...Qd6 preparing the sharp line 5...Bg6. The Norwegian Variation (also called the Taimanov or Wing Variation) (ECO C70), 3...a6 4.Ba4 b5 5.Bb3 Na5 aims to eliminate the white bishop but is generally considered too time-consuming for Black. In the Modern Steinitz Defence (also. called Neo-Steinitz Defence), 5...Bc5 is the most common move. The sharp Siesta Variation arises after 5c3 f5. The Schliemann Defence Deferred, 3...a6 4.Ba4 f5, is rarely seen, with practically its only top-level appearance being in the 1974 Candidates Final, when Viktor Korchnoi adopted it versus Anatoly Karpov. There are six ECO classifications for the Modern Steinitz. White's responses 5.d4, 5.Nc3, and 5.c4 are included in C71, while 5.0-0 is C72. The delayed exchange 5.Bxc6+ bxc6 6. d4 is C73. The Modern Arkhangelsk Defence (or Modern Archangel Defence) (ECO C78) is a refinement of the regular Arkhangel's Defence. Black normally does not fianchetto the queen's bishop, but plays ...Bg4 to increase the pressure against White's pawn centre. Fabiano Caruana is one of the most notable players of this variation, employing it in the Candidates Tournament 2020. The Riga Variation, 6...exd4, is considered inferior; the main line runs 7.Re1 d5 8.Nxc6 Bxh2+! 10.Kh1! The main line leads to unbalanced endgames which are difficult to play for both sides. The Dilworth Variation (or Attack), 11...Nxf2 12.Rxf2 f6 13.exf6 Bxf2+ 14.Kxf2 Qxf6 has scored well for Black. In the Howell Attack (ECO C81), 9.Qe2, White aims for play against d5 after Rd1. The game usually continues 9...Be7 10.Rd1 followed by 10...Nc5 or 10...0-0. 6.d3, often called the Martinez Variation, steers clear of the Marshall Attack and any of the anti-Marshall lines. Paul Keres and Boris Spassky have both played the line a few times throughout their careers. Siegbert Tarrasch played it three times in his 1911 match against Schlechter (scoring 1 win, 1 draw, 1 loss in that order), but it remains the least popular option for White on move 6. After 6...d6 the e5-pawn is firmly defended and Black threatens to trade off White's Ruy Lopez bishop with 7...b5 and 8...Na5. 6.d3 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 8.a4 b4 9.a5 d6 10.Nbd2 Be6 11.Nc4!, where White can transpose directly to the anti-Marshall line if desired by playing Re1 later. If Black elects not to exchange, however, White may retain some pull in the position. In general, if 6...b5, positions could resemble a traditional closed Spanish such as the Zaitsev. The Marshall Attack is the most common move after 11...c6. Frank James Marshall used it as a prepared variation against José Raúl Capablanca in 1918. Black generally goes all-in with a massive kingside attack, which has been analysed to great depth (sometimes beyond move 30) with no definite conclusion as to the Marshall's soundness. Many White players, including Garry Kasparov, avoid it by playing one of the anti-Marshall systems, 8.d4 or 8.h3. The Pilnik Variation, named for Hermann Pilnik, is also known as the Teichmann Variation. White plays 9.d3 intending to later advance to d4 under favourable circumstances. The Breyer Variation was recommended by Gyula Breyer as early as 1911. The Chigorin Variation has declined in popularity because Black must spend some time bringing his offside knight on a5 back into the game. The C98 classification covers 12.Nbd2 Nc6, while C99 cover 12. nbd2 cxd4 13.cxd4. The Zaitsev Variation (also called the Flohr–ZaitseV Variation) was advocated by Igor ZaitSev, who was one of Karpov's trainers for many years. With 9...Bb7 Black prepares to put more pressure on e4 after 10.d4 Re8. The Kholmov Variation, 9...Be6, was popular in the 1980s but is now played less often at the master level. The Berlin and Schliemann Defences are the most popular today, followed by the Classical Defence. The Steinitz Defence (3...d6) is solid but passive and cramped. Henry Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9−13=3. The world champion Magnus Carlsen played it in the 2014 Chess Olympiad against Ivan Šarić and lost. The Schliemann Defence or Schliamann–Jaenisch Gambit (ECO C63), 3...f5 is a sharp line in which Black plays for a kingside attack, frequently sacrificing one or two pawns. The Classical Defence or Cordel Defence (ECO C64), 3...Bc5, is possibly the oldest defence to the Ruy Lopez. Teimour Radjabov is currently the only top player who regularly employs this line, with mixed results. The Berlin Defence, 3...Nf6, has long had a reputation for solidity and drawishness and is commonly referred to as \"the Berlin Wall\" The name derives from White's play if Black captures the knight: 4...Nxe5 5.d4. An important alternative is 4.d3, dubbed the Anti-Berlin, which avoids the notorious Berlin endgame. Wilhelm Steinitz scored many spectacular successes with it during his reign as World Champion. The main replies for Black are 4...d6 and 4...Bc5, the latter being more popular. White's most important continuations after 4... Bc5 are 5.0-0, 5.Bxc6, and 5.c3.

It is a highly respected defence to 1.d4 and has been played by every world champion since Capablanca. It can also transpose into lines of the Queen's Gambit or Queen's Indian Defence. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response to the Rubinstein System.

The Larsen Variation (named after GM Bent Larsen) can be reached by either 7...Dxc4 Nc6 or 7...Nc6 9.a3 Ba5. The Main Variation was enormously popular in the 1950s but the name has become increasingly inappropriate ever since. After 4.e3 0-0 White has a huge selection of moves to choose from, and Black must be familiar with all of them. White will try to advance their centre pawns to free their bishops: c4, d5, and f3 followed by e4 are all possible. If Black can prevent White from achieving this, then they will enjoy the better game. In the Rubinstein, White has often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight, thus avoiding the doubled pawns. 4.e3 c5 is one of the most popular moves in the game.

      "\"The Nimzo-Indian Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. d4 Nf62. c4 e63. Nc3 Bb4. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings, it is classified as E20–E59. It was developed by Aron Nimzowitsch who introduced it to master-level chess in the early 20th century. It is a highly respected defence to 1.d4 and has been played by every world champion since Capablanca. It can also transpose into lines of the Queen's Gambit or Queen's Indian Defence. 4...0-0 is the most flexible and frequently played response. The Karpov Variation is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. The Larsen Variation can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Bxc3 dxc4 10.bxc3 Qc7 (Main Variation) or 7...Nc6 8.A3 Ba5 9.Bg5 Bb7 10.Rc1 and 11.Qe2 are good moves for White. After 4.e3 0-0, White has a huge selection of moves to choose from, and Black must be familiar with all of them. White will try to advance their centre pawns to free their bishops: c4, d5, and f3 followed by e4 are all possible. If Black can prevent White from achieving this, then they will enjoy the better game. There are several move orders to reach the Main Variation besides the one given above. In the Rubinstein, White often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight. 4.e3 is one of the most popular moves in the game. There are two major variations particular to 4...c5: 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3 (6.Ne2 will likely transpose to the Modern Variation) 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 is the Hübner Variation, popularized by GM Robert HüBner in the late 1960s and '70s and utilised by Bobby Fischer in his world championship match with Boris Spassky. The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5. The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. The Capablanca Position was popular in the early days of the Nimzo-Indian game, though it was superseded by the Rubinstein Variation. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are common replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (6.a3 Bxc3+ 6.Qxc3 b6 7.Bg5) White almost always plays 5.dxc5. The Pirc Variation has become unplayable at the highest level. 4...Nc6 is the Zürich or Milner-Barry Variation.

Black will generally place pressure on the c5-square and will develop an attack against White's weak queenside structure at the cost of an inferior central position. Black's 1... c5 is much sharper and more aggressive and is normally used toavoid theory. White plays 1...e5 and Black plays 1 ...c5.\"\n",

After 2.d4, Black will put pressure on the d4-square with moves such as ...Bg7, ...c5, and ...Qb6. Black obtains no immediate compensation for the sacrificed pawn. If White plays an early d4, the game will usually transpose into either the Queen's Gambit or an Indian Defence. The many different transpositional possibilities available to White make the English a slippery opening for Black to defend against. The English Opening is used by Professor Moriarty in the film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows as he and Holmes discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. The opening is also used in Pawn Sacrifice by Bobby Fischer in the climactic game six of the 1972 World Chess Championship versus Boris Spassky. The English Opening was first written by Edward Winter in the early 19th century. There are many variations of the opening, including the Fianchetto Line and the Symmetry Line. Chess is a game of chess. Chess is a form of chess and is played using the rules of the game. Chess tournaments include Chess Olympiad, Chess World Cup, Chess Grand Prix, and Chess World Championship. Chess can be played with the following moves: King's Pawn Game, King's Gambit, Queen'sGambit, and Queen's pawn Game. chess can also be played in a number of other ways: pawns, bishops, rooks, pawns and rooks.\"\n",

Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience, although some lines such as the Winawer Variation can lead to sharp complications. White usually tries to exploit the extra space on. the kings, often playing for a mating attack. Black most frequently plays 6...Ne7 (The main alternative is 6...Qc7, which can simply transpose to main lines after 7.Qg4 Ne7) White can exploit the absence of Black's dark-square bishop by playing 7. Qg4, giving Black two choices: he may sacrifice his kingside pawns with 7... Qc7 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9. Qxh7 cxd4 or he can play 7...0-0 8.Bd3 Nbc6, which avoids giving up material, but leaves the king on the flank where White is trying to attack. The Burn Variation is the most common reply at the top level. Black can also try 5...Be7 6.Bxf6 Bxf6 7.Nf3 Nd7 or 7...0-0, resulting in a position resembling those arising from the Rubinstein Variation. Black's natural French Defence move 6...c5 runs into 7.Bxe7 when Black must either move the king with 7...Kxe7 or allow 7...Qxe7 8.Nb5! with a dual threat of Nc7+ winning the rook on a8 and Nd6+. The Steinitz Variation is named after Wilhelm Steinitz. The McCutcheon Variation was brought to public attention by John Lindsay McCUTcheon, who used it to defeat Steinitz in 1885. The Rubinstein Variation can also arise from a different move order: 3.Nd2 dxe4. Black has the option of playing either Qd2 or 0-0-0, with the former typically leading to sharper positions due to opposite-side castling when Black castles kingside in both cases. 3...Nf6 is known as the Guimard Variation.

In the Exchange Variation (7.dxe5 dxe5 8.Qxd8 Rxd8), White exchanges queens and is content to play for a small, safe advantage in relatively quiet positions. The Sämisch Variation is 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f3. Black has a variety of pawn breaks, such as ...e5, ...c5 and ...b5 (prepared by ...c6 and/or ...a6). This can transpose to the Modern Benoni after 5...0-0 6.Bg5 c5 7.d5 e6. The game transposes into the Accelerated Dragon variation of the Sicilian Defence. The Four Pawns Attack continues with 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.f4 0-0 6.Nf3. With their fifth move, White erects a massive centre at the price of falling behind in development. From this 6...c5 is the main line. If White makes neutral moves such as 7.Bd3, this has had success. On the other hand, 7.e 5 is the most aggressive plan. White has other setups, such as Nf3 and h3 and Nge2 (with or without Bd3), but these are currently not as popular at the grandmaster level. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nge2 followed by 6.Ng3 is called the Hungarian Attack. One of the most famous King's Indian games was a brilliancy by the late Ukrainian-American grandmaster Eduard Gufeld, who called it his \"Mona Lisa\" Vladimir Bagirov–Eduard Gufeld, USSR championship 1973 \"The Mona Lisa\" at chessgames.comRetrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=King%27s_Indian_Defence&oldid=1\" King's Indian, Orthodox, Aronin–Taimanov Variation (Yugoslav Attack / Mar del Plata Variation) 7...Nbd7, Main line.

      "\"The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. e4 e52. Nf3 Nc63. Bb5. The opening is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO), all codes from C60 to C99 are assigned to the Ruyopez. The Morphy Defence: 3...a6 is the most commonly played third move for Black. 3...a6 is played in over 65 percent of all games beginning with the Ruy Lopez. The most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. After 4...dxc6, Black almost always responds 4...Dxc6. The Exchange Variation, 4.Bxc6 (ECO C68–C69) damages Black's pawn structure, gaining a ready-made long-term plan of playing d4 ...exd4 Qxd4, followed by exchanging all the pieces. The Norwegian Variation (also called the Taimanov or Wing Variation) (ECO C70), 3...a6 4.Ba4 b5 5.Bb3 Na5 aims to eliminate the white bishop but is generally considered too time-consuming for Black. In the Modern Steinitz Defence (also. called Neo-Steinitz Defence), 5...Bc5 is played. The Graz Defence, Classical Defence Deferred, and Møller Defence combine 3... a6 with the active move ...C5. The sharp Siesta Variation arises after 5c3 f5. There are six ECO classifications for the Modern Steinitz. White's responses 5.d4, 5.Nc3, and 5.c4 are included in C71, while 5.0-0 is C72. The Schliemann Defence Deferred, 3...a6 4.Ba4 f5, is rarely seen, with practically its only top-level appearance being in the 1974 Candidates Final, when Viktor Korchnoi adopted it versus Anatoly Karpov. The Modern Arkhangelsk Defence (or Modern Archangel Defence) (ECO C78) is a refinement of the regular Arkhangel's Defence by incorporating ideas similar to the Møller Defence.

It was first played on October 31, 1985 in New York City. The game was won by Ruy Lopez with a score of 7.5/8.\"\n",

The opening is fairly popular with beginners who strictly adhere to the opening principle: \"Develop knights before bishops.\" It was one of the workhorses in the family of the Open Game, at even the highest levels, until World War I. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.Nc3 Nf6 4...Bc5 5.Nxe4 d5 7.Neg5+ Kg8 5.Bxf7+?, though superficially attractive, relinquishes the bishop pair and central control to Black. A better move order for White that leads to this position is via the Giuoco Piano. A Halloween Gambit style 4...Nxe 4 has also been tried at the grandmaster level as in two games between Ilya Smirin.

      "\"The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening characterised by the moves:1. e4 e52. Nf3 Nc63. Bb5. The opening is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. The theory of the Ruyopez is the most extensively developed of all Open Games. The most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. The Exchange Variation, 4.Bxc6, (ECO C68–C69) White damages Black's pawn structure, gaining a ready-made long-term plan of playing d4 ...exd4 Qxd4, followed by exchanging all the pieces. The Steinitz Defence (3...d6) is solid but passive and cramped. Henry Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9−13=3 (nine wins, thirteen losses, three draws) The world champion Magnus Carlsen played it in the 2014 Chess Olympiad against Ivan Šarić and lost.

      "\"The Ruy Lopez is a chess opening named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with many variations. A common nickname for the opening is \"The Spanish Torture\" The most commonly played third move for Black is the Morphy Defence, 3...a6, a move that forces White to retreat or exchange for Black's knight. The opening remains the most commonly used amongst the open games in master play. It has been adopted by almost all players during their careers, many have played it with both colours. 3...a6 is played in over 65 percent of all games beginning with the Ruy Lopez. The most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. Black almost always responds 4...dxc6. The Exchange Variation, 4.Bxc6, (ECO C68–C69) White damages Black's pawn structure, gaining a ready-made long-term plan of playing d4 ...exd4 Qxd4, followed by exchanging all the pieces. The Graz Defence, Classical Defence Deferred, and Møller Defence combine 3...a6 with the active move ...Bc5. The Norwegian Variation (also called the Taimanov or Wing Variation) aims to eliminate the white bishop but is generally considered too time-consuming for Black. In the Modern Steinitz Defence, Black is able to maintain control of the centre. The sharp Siesta Variation arises after 5c3 f5 while a calmer game from the 5...Bd7 Defence is also possible. The Schliemann Defence Deferred, 3...a6 4.Ba4 f5, is rarely seen, with practically its only top-level appearance being in the 1974 Candidates Final, when Viktor Korchnoi adopted it versus Anatoly Karpov. There are six ECO classifications for the Modern Steinitz. White's responses 5.d4, 5.Nc3, and 5.c4 are included in C71, while 5.0-0 is C72. The delayed exchange 5.Bxc6+ bxc6 6. d4 is C73. The Modern Arkhangelsk Defence (ECO C78) is a refinement of the regular Arkhangel's Defence by incorporating ideas similar to the Møller Defence. Black normally does not fianchetto the queen's bishop, but plays ...Bg4 to increase the pressure against White's pawn centre. Fabiano Caruana is one of the most notable players of this variation, employing it in the Candidates Tournament 2020. The Riga Variation, 6...exd4, is considered inferior; the main line runs 7.Re1 d5 8.Nxd4 Bd6! The main line leads to unbalanced endgames which are difficult to play for both sides. The Dilworth Variation (or Attack), 11...Nxf2 12.Rxf2 f6 13.exf6 Bxf2+ 14.Kxf2 Qxf6 has scored well for Black. The Howell Attack (ECO C81), 9.Qe2, White aims for play against d5 after Rd1. Paul Keres played this line against Max Euwe and Samuel Reshevsky at the World Chess Championship tournament 1948. In the Worrall Attack (ECO C86), White replaces 6.Re1 with 6.Qe2. Paul Keres and Boris Spassky have both played the line a few times throughout their careers. Siegbert Tarrasch played it three times in his 1911 match against Schlechter (scoring 1 win, 1 draw, 1 loss in that order) Nigel Short essayed it twice in his 1992 match against Anatoly Karpov and won both games. 6.d3 is a modern tabiya of the Ruy Lopez. 6...d6 is the only move besides d4 to ever be seriously considered. In the Averbakh Variation, Black defends the threatened e-pawn with 6 ...d6 instead of driving away the white bishop with the more common 6...b5. This defence shares some similarities with the Modern Steinitz and Russian Defences as Black avoids the ...b5 advance that weakens the queenside. Black may sacrifice a pawn with d3, 8a, 8h3, d4, or any of the alternative moves of the Trajković Variation. White can circumvent the Marshall Attack after 6...Bb3, which is commonly referred to as \"anti-anti-Marshall\" The Marshall Attack is a gambit used by Frank James Marshall against José Raúl Capablanca in 1918. Black plays the gambit 8...d5, sacrificing a pawn. The most common move after 11...c6 is the most common in modern play. Black generally goes all-in with a massive kingside attack, which has been analysed to great depth (sometimes beyond move 30) The main line begins with 9.exd5 Nxd5 (9...e4?!, the Herman Steiner variation, is considered weaker) 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 c6, and 11...Bb7 are considered inferior. The Pilnik Variation, named for Hermann Pilnik, is also known as the Teichmann Variation. The Breyer Variation was recommended by Gyula Breyer as early as 1911. Boris Spassky has a career-plus score with the Breyer. The Chigorin Variation has declined in popularity because Black must spend some time bringing his offside knight on a5 back into the game. Black generally plays 14g6 to stop White's knight going to f5. The Zaitsev Variation (also called the Flohr–ZaitseV Variation) was advocated by Igor ZaitSEv, who was one of Karpov's trainers for many years. With 9...Bb7 Black prepares to put more pressure on e4 after 10.d4 Re8. The Kholmov Variation, 9...Be6, was popular in the 1980s but is now played less often at the master level. The Berlin and Schliemann Defences are the most popular today, followed by the Classical Defence. The Steinitz Defence (3...d6) is solid but passive and cramped. Henry Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9−13=3 (nine wins, thirteen losses, three draws) The world champion Magnus Carlsen played it in the 2014 Chess Olympiad against Ivan Šarić and lost. The Schliemann Defence or Schliemaker–Jaenisch Gambit (ECO C63), 3...f5 is a sharp line in which Black plays for a kingside attack. The Classical Defence or Cordel Defence (ECO C64), 3...Bc5 is possibly the oldest defence to the Ruy Lopez. Teimour Radjabov is currently the only top player who regularly employs this line, with mixed results. The name derives from White's play if Black captures the knight: 4...Nxe5 5.d4. The Berlin Defence, 3...Nf6, has long had a reputation for solidity and drawishness and is commonly referred to as \"the Berlin Wall\" An important alternative is 4.d3, dubbed the Anti-Berlin, which avoids the notorious Berlin endgame. Wilhelm Steinitz scored many spectacular successes with it during his reign as World Champion. The main replies for Black are 4...d6 and 4...Bc5, the latter of which is playable in the Berlin Defense, unlike the Exchange Variation in the Morphy Defense. Less-common third moves for Black:3...Bb4 (Alapin Defence)3...Qf6 (Gunderam Variation)\"\n",

White usually plays on the queenside in this variation, while Black will try to play on the kingside with ...f5. Garry Kasparov used it to great effect against Anatoly Karpov in their 1985 World Championship match.

      "\"The French Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves 1.e4 e6 and 2.d4 d5. Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The Steinitz Variation is named after Wilhelm Steinitz. The McCutcheon Variation was brought to public attention by John Lindsay McCUTcheon, who used it to defeat World Champion Steinitz in 1885. The Advance Variation, played with an expectation of an early draw, is the most difficult to play against due to the closed structure and unique strategies of the system. Black's natural French Defence move 6...c5 runs into 7.Bxe7 when Black must either move the king with 7...Kxe7 or allow 7...Qxe7 8.Nb5! The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings includes an alphanumeric classification system for openings that is widely use. The system was developed by the Russian chess theoretician Evgeny Sveshnikov. It is based on a system of alphanumerical letters and numbers. The alphabetical system is used to identify the different types of Chess openings.

      "\"The French Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves 1.e4 e6 and 2.d4 d5. Black usually plays ...c5 soon after, attacking White's pawn centre and gaining space on the queenside. The French has a reputation for solidity and resilience, although some lines such as the Winawer Variation can lead to sharp complications. Black's position is often somewhat cramped in the early game; in particular, the pawn on e6 can impede the development of the bishop on c8. In the diagrammed position, Black most frequently plays 6...Ne7 (The main alternative is 6...Qc7, which can simply transpose to main lines after 7.Qg4 Ne7, but Black also has the option of 7. Qg4 f5 or ...f6). Now White can exploit the absence of Black's dark-square bishop by playing 7. qg4, giving Black two choices: he may sacrifice his kingside pawns with 7...Q c7 8.Qxg7 Rg8 9.Qh7 cxd4 but destroy White's centre in return. Or he can play 7...0-0 8.Bd3 Nbc6, which avoids giving up material, but leaves the king on the flank where White is trying to attack. 4...b6 followed by ...Ba6, or 4...Qd7 with the idea of meeting 5.Qg4 with 5...f5. 4...dxe4 5.Nxe4 and usually there now follows: 5...Be7 6.Bxf6 Bxf6 7.Nf3 Nd7 or 7...0-0. Another line that resembles the Rubinstein is 5...Nbd 7 6.F3 Be7 (6...h6 is also tried) The McCutcheon Variation is named for John Lindsay McCutcheson, who used it to defeat Wilhelm Steinitz in 1885. The Steinitz Variation continues with 4.e5 Nfd7. After 3...dxe4, Black has the following options:The mainline 4...Nd7 (the most frequent high-level exponent of this variation is Georg Meier). Play might typically proceed 5.Nf3 Ngf6 6.Nxf6+ Nxf6 when Black is ready for ...c5. 3...Nf6 is known as the Guimard Variation. The Morozevich Variation is a fashionable line among top GMs in recent years. 3...Be7 is a rare move which gained some popularity in the 1970s. 4...exd5 was a staple of many old Karpov–Korchnoi battles, including seven games in their 1974 FIDE Candidates match. 4.e5 Nfd7 5.Bd3 c5 6.c3 Nc6 (6...b6 intends ...Ba6 next to get rid of Black's \"bad\" light-square bishop, a recurring idea in the French) 7.Ne2 (leaving f3 open for the queen's knight) 8.cxd4 f6 9.exf6 Nxf6 10.Nf3 Bd6 Black has freed his pieces at the cost of having a backward pawn on e6. The Advance Variation is a closed system with a complex structure and unique strategies due to the closed structure and strategies of the system. The French Defence is the most difficult opening to play against due to its closed structure. The main line is 3...c5 4.c3 Nc6 5.Nf3 and then we have a branching point:5...Qb6, the idea is to increase the pressure on d4 and eventually undermine the white centre. White's most common replies are 6.a3, 6.Be2 and 6.Bd3. 5...Bd7 was mentioned by Greco as early as 1620 and popularised by Viktor Korchnoi in 1970s. Despite the symmetrical pawn structure, White cannot force a draw. An obsession with obtaining one sometimes results in embarrassment for White. White will often play c2–c4 at some stage to put pressure on Black's d5-pawn. Black can give White an isolated queen's pawn by capturing on c4. This gives White's pieces greater freedom, which may lead to attacking chances. The positions are so symmetrical that the options and strategies are the same for both sides. Another way to unbalance the position is for White or Black to castle on opposite sides of the board. The French Defence is named after a match played by correspondence between the cities of London and Paris in 1834. Black usually replies 2...c5, after which play can resemble the 2.d3 variation or the Closed Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Play can continue 2...d5 3. e5 c5 4. Nf3 Nc6 5.c3 Nge7 6.Na3 Nf5.

The Karpov Variation is one of Black's most reliable defences to the Rubinstein System. The Larsen Variation can be reached by either 7...dxc4 8.Bxc4 Nc6 9.a3 Bxc3 dxc4 10.bxc3 Qc7 (Main Variation) or 7...Nc6 8.a2 Ba5 (Larsen) or 8...Bd7 followed by ...Bc6 is the Bronstein Variation. The Rubinstein Variation has a huge selection of moves to choose from, and Black must be familiar with all of them. White will try to advance their centre pawns to free their bishops: c4, d5, and f3 followed by e4 are all possible. If Black can prevent White from achieving this, then they will enjoy the better game. In the Rubinstein, White has often resorted to playing Ne2 rather than Nf3 at some point to be able to recapture on c3 with the knight. 4.e3 c5 is one of the most popular moves in the game. There are two major variations particular to 4...c5: 5.Bd3 Nc6 6.Nf3 (6.Ne2 will likely transpose to the Modern Variation) 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 is the Hübner Variation, popularized by GM Robert HüBner in the late 1960s and '70s and utilised by Bobby Fischer. The Classical Fianchetto Variation can be reached through two move orders: 4.e3 b6 5.Bd3 Bb7 6.Nf3 0-0 7.0-0 d5. The Keres Variation is named after Estonian GM Paul Keres, although Smyslov and Bronstein were also early practitioners of this line. Black often sets up a Hedgehog formation (pawns on a6, b6, d6 and e6), while White will try to pursue a strategy of gaining queenside space with b4 and c5. 4...0-0, 4...c5, 4 ...d5, and 4...Nc6 are all common replies to 4.Qc2. Black can choose to recapture on c5 with the bishop (e.g. 5...Bxc5) or with the knight (after 5...Na6 or 6.Nf3 Na6) The Pirc Variation was not popular during the mid-20th century, because the lines where Black eventually recaptures with theKnight was reckoned to give Black easy equality. 4...Nc6 is the Zürich or Milner-Barry Variation. Black gives up the dark-squared bishop, but places their central pawns on d6 and e5 so that their remaining bishop is unimpeded. 4...d5 transposes to the Ragozin Defence of the Queen's Gambit Declined and 4...b6. The Nimzo/Queen's Indian hybrid line is the most common move that stays within Nimzo-Indian territory. Black has dissolved White's centre, but the bishop on g2 exerts pressure on the black queenside, which White may augment with 9b3.

Boris Spassky has a career-plus score with the Breyer. The Chigorin Variation has declined in popularity because Black must spend some time bringing his offside knight on a5 back into the game. White usually plays 9.h3 instead of 9.d4 (the Yates Variation) because after 9. d4 Bg4 the pin of the white king knight is troublesome.\"\n",
